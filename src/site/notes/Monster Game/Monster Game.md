## The Turn
### Phase One: Deployment
- Restore any spent SP
- Add 1 to your total SP to a maximum of 10.
- Select units to be placed in your deployment zone. 
	- You may deploy as many units as you want, so long as you have the SP to do so.
### Phase Two: Spellcasting
- Channel a spell by placing it in the spell slot on the right-hand side of the board. The spell will then be cast when it reaches the nexus.
- If a spell is already in the spell slot when you reach the spellcasting phase, advance it a number of spaces equal to its polarity.
- The Ehb is the space between the spell slot and the nexus. Certain effects may occur here.
- When a spell reaches the nexus, active its effect and place it back into your roster.
### Phase Three: Movement
- Select units to move. They may advance a number of spaces up to or equaling their agility in any direction.
	- Units may not end their turn in or return to the deployment zone unless an effect states otherwise.
	- Units may move through allies freely, but may not end their movement in the same space. Units may not move through hostile units unless an effect states otherwise.
	- Only certain units may enter the opponent's safe zone.
### Phase Four: Combat
- Select a unit to make an attack.
	- If the Unit is making a melee attack, subtract the target’s Hitpoints by your Strength score.
	- If the Unit is making a ranged attack, or is Agile, subtract the target’s Hitpoints by your Agility score.
	- If the Unit is Flying, it may attack other flying units. If it attacks a grounded unit with a melee attack, it becomes grounded until your next turn.
- When a unit's hitpoints are reduces to 0, it is removed from play.
### Phase Five: Consolidation
- You may use any remaining movement (but not attack again). Certain spells and abilities may trigger during this phase.
