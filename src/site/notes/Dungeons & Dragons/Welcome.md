# About
---
Hi! This is (presently) my Dungeons & Dragons archive.

I'll keep this site updated with stuff as you guys learn about it in the game. You'll find information on places you've been, people you've met, and the artifacts you've found.

This landing page will include the current topic and related info.

Alas, the site where this is published is very limited. You may find the formatting off in some places, and images will not be present.

# Campaign of the Rotting Crypts
---
*A magical rot has begun to spread beneath Guild, threatening one of the last bastions of trade and security in the Outer Bailey. The dead rise in its wake, and the living who linger are driven mad by its mold. The city's senate is nowhere to be found, barred away in their golden districts. The renowned Merchwardens, Guild's defenders, dare not risk their own out of pride and spite. The only hope, it seems, lies in Tir's faithfulâ€”yet even they are on their last light.*

## House Rules
- **Felled.** Upon reaching 0 hitpoints, rather than falling unconscious, you are felled. This condition follows the same rules as unconscious but you can still speak, and you're still aware of your surroundings. You have a movement of 1 that does not prompt attacks of opportunity as you slowly crawl from danger. You will still die if you fail all of your death saves.
