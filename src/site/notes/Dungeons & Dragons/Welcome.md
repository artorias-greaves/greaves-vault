# About
---
Hi! This is (presently) my Dungeons & Dragons archive.

I'll keep this site updated with stuff as you guys learn about it in the game. You'll find information on places you've been, people you've met, artifacts you've found, and important documents.

This landing page will include a synopsis of the current campaign, party status, and related articles.

Alas, the site where this is published is very limited. You may find the formatting off in some places, and images may not be present.

# Campaign of the Warded Walls

## Party Status
Sheltered; downtime.
