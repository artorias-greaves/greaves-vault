**Goal:** Describe a system or template that can be applied to every combat encounter to make it engaging from start to finish.

# Current Observations
---
Significant factors in composing engaging combat encounters that I've noticed in trend as a DM. My thoughts on combat tend to differ when I'm a player. 
## 5e Combat Cycle
- ==Speed and stake seem to be key in maintaining excitement.==
- Foregoing initiative produced an exciting and streamlined round or two.
- Designing combat around a ==2-4 round maximum (as a guideline)== has proven to be effective, even if the players are fighting giant rats in an empty room.
- The whole cycle of 5th edition combat is mechanically slow. 
	- ==Unlike other aspects of our games, I can't recall a 'golden age' where 5e combat as a system aligned for all of us== (except in highly specific, low-level encounters). On the contrary—more so when I'm a player—I tend to have more fun the *less frequently* combat occurs.
- ==Tracking damage taken for my units alone is a monstrous task== (not to mention ability scores, current status, then roleplay/fluff/voice). Anything we can do to simplify the system would help.
- The structure of requiring multiple player-to-DM pings per turn carries a ==fundamental hinderance in maintaining fluidity in the transition between the loose, exploratory nature of D&D and the rules-strict, high-stakes wargames that are combat encounters==.
	- **Current structure:**
		- Player: I perform an action (attack).
		- DM: Check for the outcome.
		- Player: I check for the outcome.
		- DM: You hit. Check for the outcome.
		- Player: I check for the outcome.
		- DM: This is the outcome.
	- **Structure of the rest of D&D:**
		- Player: I perform an action.
		- DM: Check for the outcome.
		- Player: I check for the outcome.
		- DM: This is the outcome.
- It often seems like ==the best combat encounters are those that are indistinguishable from the rest of the game==, or even where actual, direct *fighting* may not be happening.
	- Think incoming volleys of arrows while you scale a cliffside, for example. There are archer NPCs, they have an armor class of 13, movement of 30 feet (15 because of the knee-high snow), and they're firing longbows at you with +4 to hit and 1d8+2 piercing damage—but I'm not making attack rolls vs. your AC. I don't bother with any of that. I'm likely describing the hail of arrows making you lose your grip, roll a skill check please and thank you. If damage does occur here, it's a measured nudge towards a potential fail state.
		- Now imagine rules as written, where you are in a turn order and I'm trying to account for every literal attack roll made your way, while keeping record of everyone's stats, damage types, range... They are fundamentally different presentations of the same thing, but one is actually exciting to be a part of (unless you *really* like wargames).
	- Another example, much more common than the first, is when the players are in a *transition between combat*. Think stealth through a bandit camp, where you're whispering across the table (or mic) as your characters tip-toe around sleeping enemies—but being seen immediately demands the initiation of the combat ruleset, thus inserting an uncanny *break* while everyone rolls initiative and the DM scrambles to do the same (on top of their regular duties).
		- ==The call for initiative can often be tense, but it is nonetheless a break in the flow of the game.== Whatever the preestablished momentum or *vibe*, it is reset in favor of the new 'game' that we then swap to. It is evident in the change in music; the confusion when one player takes a violent action and another asks "are we in combat?"; how we move our tokens on the map according to our 'combat status'.
## On Fluff & Flavor
- Inserting fluff seems ==both vital and antithetical to exciting combat== and maintaining meaningful engagement.
	- Encounters that go on for more than 2 rounds are doomed to hear the same awkward descriptions from me over and over.
	- Are you guys really holding a coherent mental image throughout our combat encounters? i.e. Is choreographing combat's every action worth it? If not, which ones?
	- ==The shorter the encounter, generally, the better.==
		- This necessitates a **baseline unforgiving combat environment**, which may dissuade certain roleplay-centric decisions by design (encourages genuine tactics and planning though!).
- ==I rely almost solely on the board==; the call to initiative turns the game from a collaborative storytelling exercise, existing mostly in the theatre of the mind, into a wargame that you would not otherwise care to describe further than "my knight hits your warlock for 6 damage". In short, ==it turns into a video game==.
- Choreographing ==combat is exhausting and leaves open a wide door for me to forget something== and break the flow of the game; I don't need a combat encounter to forget that an NPC has been beside you the whole session, apparently just silently observing.
## 'The Third Target'
- This concept describes ==a third or additional factor that the players must consider in a combat encounter== (the first two 'targets' being the players themselves and the enemy units). It usually consists of one or multiple of the following components:
	- **Assault.** Plan an infiltration or assault on a location, typically complex or fortified against the players' favor.
	- **Time.** A hostage is about to be executed. The compound is about to explode. The 'third target' here relates to the constraint of time, typically a limit in turns elapsed.
	- **Cargo.** Someone needs to be kept alive, or something needs to be kept safe—and the bad guys are trying to achieve the opposite. Often ties in well with a time constraint.
	- **Environment.** Fire makes the oil burn. Ice makes the ground slippery. This ledge is awful steep, and that wall looks ready to fall. The archers are using a river to their advantage, and armored knights hold a narrow doorway.
	- **Precious.** Naturally, the higher the stakes (provided they are developed—the death of a five-minute friend is forgotten in five minutes), the more invested the players should be in the moment.
- Highly ==effective as a template for interesting encounters, but fails to address the underlying issues== in the 5e combat cycle, and limitations that some DMs face—even compounding the latter.
## DM's Limitations
- ==Improvisation and multitasking are both difficult for me== as it relates to playing D&D (as player and DM). It's an issue that seems to persist through multiple layers of preparation and prevention—you might notice it most prominently in forgetting NPCs and events (within combat and without), changing voices or personalities, and tracking combat in general. 
	- Alas, I feel these are some of the most effective skills a DM can have, and lacking them is a significant source of our current qualms with combat.
# Alternative Rulesets
---
Options that may be worth exploring at some point. 5th edition as written has fundamental conditions that I feel negatively impact engagement in combat-oriented gameplay. That being said, ==I'm not entirely convinced it would be better to change the rules that we've been familiarizing ourselves with for years.==
## Visceral Roll System
Simplified from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG7fz56PHJE
### Initiative
- Initiative is no longer rolled. The DM rapidly dictates turn order based on player readiness, character ability (*Alert*, for example), and in-world circumstances.
	- Once all participating parties have acted, the turn order has been established and combat resumes as normal.
### Attack & Damage
- You no longer make attack rolls. Instead, roll damage directly.
- If you roll a 1, you miss. 
- If you make your highest roll (4 on a d4), you crit and roll that die again, adding it to the result.
	- Effects that alter your crit chance still apply (i.e. 3-4 being a crit on a d4 if an ability would have made 19-20 a crit on a d20).
- For damage rolls that use multiple dice (i.e. Greatsword's 2d6), there are three methods available to resolve the attack:
	1. The player must, prior to the roll, select one die in the array to be the *Primary Die*: This die will determine a hit, miss, or crit. Rolling with advantage or disadvantage is done with this die solely.
	2. Following the first method, your lowest roll becomes your *Primary Die.*
	3. Each die is its own 'mini' attack roll: Missing or critting with one has no impact on the other. Rolling with advantage or disadvantage is done with each die. This is a more chaotic method, ~~and it's objectively more fun and immersive than the former methods—but holy shit can that add up to a lot of dice rolling~~.
### Armor Class
- Armor Class is now separated into five broader categories:
	- **Exposed.** (AC 0-7) — The attacker is guaranteed to hit, circumstances permitting. Note that *Unarmored Defence* or an otherwise unarmored character does not necessarily fall under this category.
	- **Light.** (AC 8-12) — The attacker's damage applies as normal.
	- **Medium.** (AC 13-17) — The attacker no longer uses their stat modifier when calculating damage.
	- **Heavy.** (AC 18-20) — The attacker's damage is resisted (halved), in addition to the previous effect.
	- **Reinforced.** (AC 22+) — The attacker must crit to do damage, in addition to the previous effect.
	- Resistance does not stack. For example, if a target takes damage it is naturally resistant to, while having a *heavy* armor class, the target will take half damage as usual.
### Projected Results
- **Pro:**
	- **One less step.** Subtracting an entire section from 5th edition combat while retaining a similar semblance of balance and flow; simplifying this vital game process and potentially allowing the other pillars of D&D to shine brighter during combat encounters.
	- **Armor classes.** Retaining armor class and armor archetypes as valuable choices for the players while keeping the new categories reasonable enough that the players feel both encouraged to boost their AC beyond the norm, and unburdened in trying to achieve an effect that relates to their character. In other words, it should still be as customizable as the original rule.
	- **Greater combat dynamics.** In the greatsword example above, a new question emerges as to whether or not each dice roll of the 2d6 could target a separate enemy. Also—advantage is boring (and a bit more complicated in this system—see above). Instead, imagine you did something to *expose* your enemy in combat, and now the next attack is guaranteed to hit. We would need to brainstorm a handful of new triggers, but here are some examples:
		- Advantage against the target turns into an attack vs. *exposed* armor. Disadvantage is vs. *reinforced* armor.
		- As an action, potentially render your target's armor *exposed* for the next attack made against it.
			- As an action, become *reinforced* for the next attack made against you.
	- **Immersive hit rate.** You're no longer prone to repeatedly missing a logically slower or weaker opponent on account of poor rolls.
- **Con:**
	- Fundamentally alters 5th edition balance without playtesting.
	- Proficiency bonus no longer has any application in combat.
	- Might benefit certain damage arrays (weapons) over others? 
		- You have a 25% chance to crit or miss with a d4 damage weapon, but a 10% chance to crit or miss with d10 damage. This makes weapons with a higher average damage have a lower chance to crit than weaker weapons. 
			- Is this intentional? Is this preferrable? Is this even how probability works? Please advise.
	- Only addresses speed of combat, not factors regarding fluff descriptions and improv ability.
	- Yet another house rule to remember; this would become the main reason for breaks in combat flow due to initial confusion.
# Conclusions
---
## Core Components of Rewarding Combat
- **Speed.** The speed in which decisions are made, turns are passed, and results are calculated—both as a game mechanic and faucet of the living world—are vital to creating a captivating combat encounter. The outcome of a battle should be predictable after the first round. After the second round—unless your players ended it with some expenditure of resources—one party should be retreating, surrendering, dying, or dumping all of their resources into turn three.
- **Stakes.** Combat encounters should never exist just because you need combat encounters. Units on the field exist as obstacles, the same as a risky bridge, and the players should have more reasons for navigating them than doing so for the hell of it. Make them rush into the unknown. Make them commit to the unplanned. If they *really* only just need to cross the bridge, foot over foot? The grass on the other side better be pretty damn green.
- **Dilemma.** The stage is set and the mission is clear—but what's stopping the players from reaching their goal? You'd better hope it's not *yet another attack roll*. If it's come down to a series of monotone, uninspired mumbles and dice rolls on either side, you should have made them do it while it was raining fire and the floor was lava on every odd round.
- **Engagement.** To what degree can the players interact with their surroundings? The more the better. If they're forced to do so as a mechanism of the encounter? Perfect—just give them a warning round if they don't get it at first. Every combat ought to include at *least* one win condition that's integrated into the battlefield, even if it's just elevation. (Why not let the bad guys use them too?)
- **Immersion.** The most nebulous concept here, but it probably lies downstream from these other components, in combination (in small part) with the group's preestablished acting and storytelling experience and application thereof. Enemy callouts. Unique, plausible behaviors. Use skills to their fullest (I'm only now just recalling the potential in the Noosemen stat block that I just *forgot* to use).
## From Here?
- Without altering 5e's combat system:
	- *Planned* combat encounters can always be deliberately crafted as thought-provoking puzzles with flexible and fulfilling solutions, **but:**
	- There will probably *always* be a recurring 'break' in engagement or immersion that occurs due to matters relating to the bloated combat system and my ability to choreograph varied actions and behaviors on the fly (among other issues).
- Improvement comes from practice, so it follows that each successive combat raises the chances that we'll enjoy the next. In any case, we're all enjoying the game enough now to come back next week.
