*Nobody really knows how long ago historical events took place or when they happened relative to each-other. Time is a loose concept in the realm, with no phases of the moon or discernable seasons to help its inhabitants track longer timeframes, like weeks or months. Instead, most of its inhabitants live day-to-day, recalling the past through vague references of time like 'three nights ago', or 'in the time of my grandfather'.*

*Most mortals cannot recall the time before the God Wars or emergence of the Ylvari, for example, but many reports and references put these events to have happened between 5 to 15 generations ago. The Golden Age is a chapter of time that only the most venerable of mortals can recall—agents of the House of the Sun, for example.*

# Mythos
---
## Twin Giant Wizards
- Since before time, when Nothing filled the void, there existed two brothers—'Big Hat' [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Outer Influences/Anwe\|Anwe]], a wizard empowered by potential, and [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Outer Influences/Torrid\|Torrid]] 'Longrobes', a wizard cursed with the power of decay.
- These brothers were born of the same essence, but were opposite in nature: Anwe, with his wide-brimmed hat, embodied the endless expanse of creativity, possibility, and growth. Wherever the cusp of his hat reached, new stars ignited, new laws spun into existence, and life appeared in countless forms.
- Torrid, draped in long, fraying robes that absorbed all under its mantle, personified the inevitable decay that follows all of creation: Stagnation, withering, and death. His power was not born of malice, but of the natural order of decline. Torrid reveled in the quiet finality of things, but he did not scorn Anwe or his creations, for he always had influence in them.
