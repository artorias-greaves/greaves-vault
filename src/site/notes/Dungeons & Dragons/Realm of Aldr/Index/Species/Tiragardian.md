Once the chosen race of the gods, the ancient **Tiragardians** lost their immortality after [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/God Wars\|warring]] against their [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Outer Influences/Outer Influences\|creators]]. Now they exist as fractured kingdoms and cities with little influence over the lands their crumbled [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Tiragard/Tiragard\|empire]] once claimed.

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your ability scores each increase by 1.
- **Age.** Tiragardians reach adulthood in their late teens and live to be just under 2 centuries.
- **Alignment.** Tiragardians tend to look out for themselves first. They are mistrusting, especially of Ylvari (and each other), but tend to cover all ranges of alignments. They are, quite literally, the best and worst inhabitants of the world.
- **Size.** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 or 7 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.
- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Imperial Common, Tradespeak, and one extra language of your choice. Wizened Tiragardians might be familiar with High Common, the language of their ancestors, or consort with Dwarriden runesmiths in Rûngar as a matter of trade.
## Variant: Player's Handbook

## Variant: Divine Lineage
A Tiragardian may discover that they are a distant descendant of a god. Depending on their bloodline, they may gain an effect that sets them apart from normal Tiragardians. This is in addition to the variant rules provided by the Player's Handbook.

| Lineage          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Effect(s)                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| House of the Sun | Descendants of the immortal Tir and his consort, Eir. This terrifying progeny returns from death with the rising sun, losing a small piece of their soul in the process. The best among the House of the Sun are great heroes and scholars, while the worst are immortal tyrants, maddened by repeated death.                                 | If you have died, you return to life at sunrise. You lose half of your total experience points but retain your level. In addition, your character is inflicted with a new **Madness**.                           |
| House of Lies    | The dynasty of Sarn and Phoheida is as feared as it is respected. These Tiragardians are able to swap faces at will. As a result, notable people in their nation are identified by their unique mask rather than their true face.                                                                                                             | Once per day, as an action, you can change the appearance of your face and voice to match one that you’ve previously seen. You stay in this new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or die. |
| House of Stars   | The House of Stars has long been separate from Tiragard. They scorn their own race's involvement in the affairs of who they deem the 'true gods': The Outer and Inner Influences. They are descendants of Tiragardians who took the blessings of the realm itself, rather than their fellows who usurped divinity. Commonly druids and seers. | Once per day, as an action, you must consult your patron deity. You are guaranteed some form of response.                                                                                                        |
| Ehbing Blood     | Descendant from a Tiragardian-Ylvari affair or afflicted by some other magical means, whether it be distant relation to Phoheida or influence by the Third Will, you were born with the Ehb in your veins.                                                                                                                                    | As an action, you may change your Spellcasting Ability.                                                                                                                                            |
| Lowborn          | You're nobody in particular. Your disconnection from the lineage of the gods has allowed your kind to forge their own legacies, untethered by fate.                                                                                                                                                                                           | You gain a feat.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
# Ethnicities
---
While there are few diverse ethnic groups amongst the Tiragardians due to the homogeneity of their first empire, their cultures and racial characteristics began to make significant deviations after the God Wars and decentralization of the Tiragardian population.
## Akridan
The Akridans initially existed as the priest caste of old Tiragard—servants, clerics, and prophets—who made a long exodus across the realm preceding the God Wars. They settled in what is now known as the Akridan Desert, developing darker skin accordingly. These Tiragardians maintained their connection to The Maker and tend to spurn the other gods for their influence.
## Baelic
The Baelic people make up the Tiragardian population of the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Outer Bailey/Outer Bailey\|Outer Bailey]], from where they get their name. There are no true defining characteristics of Baelics—in fact, most would not use this term, as they have little cultural identity beyond the city or town they inhabit. Most Baelics are likely descendants from farmers, merchants, warriors, and minor nobility from the old empire. Their skin ranges from pale to tan, olive to black. They are a hardy people; born-survivors in a world that seems destined to oppose them.

**Male Names:** Arek, Carmik, Gormander.
**Female Names:** Lumen, Nacha, Ylva.
**Asexual Names:** Umber, Glofin, Zari.
## Craven

## Lotharian
The Lotharians, direct descendants of the god Tir, possess traces of ancient immortality in their blood. They are Tiragardians who remained loyal to their god following the God Wars, fleeing Fallen Tiragard and establishing a new center of power. Their immortality showed itself to be a curse, however, and now Lotharians are afflicted with everlasting lives in bodies that fail to support them. Their name comes from a folk hero named Lothar, a general of Tir who led the Lotharians out of Tiragard following its collapse.

Despite their harrowing appearance, tyrannical rulers, and cursed realm of fog, the Lotharians are the closest descendants of the first Tiragardians—and their kingdom the closest in form to ancient Tiragard.

**Male Names:** Elira, Kas, Fel, Sargon, Lathas.
**Female Names:** 
**Asexual Names:** 
## Pyric
## Sarnican
A secluded and mysterious people who originated as a heretical cabal within Tiragardian society. Due to their widespread participation in [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Magic#Fetish\|Fetish]] magic, they are pale, gaunt, and frequently haunted, and view the other races and ethnicities with derision. After the God Wars, they followed Sarn's will and founded a new [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Sarnica\|empire]] beyond the Warded Walls. While goodwill and heroism may exist amongst Sarnicans, most are far too oppressed or brainwashed to do anything with it.

**Male Names:** August, Callus, Invictus, Vaté, Valor.
**Female Names:** Amalié, Cuirum, Pharodra, Vintna.
**Asexual Names:** Svilto, Finé.
