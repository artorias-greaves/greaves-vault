- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2.
- **Age.** Dwarriden emerge from the earth in a mature state, but aloof. A Dwarriden's experience determines its age as opposed to celestial or earthly cycles. Except in the wear of their stone hunches, Dwarriden show no other signs of aging. They have no known 'expiration date'.
- **Alignment.** Most Dwarriden are lawful and orderly as a matter of nature. They broadly thrive for the protection of natural orders and service to honorable Tiragardians—both lingering aspects of their ancient mandate.
- **Size.** Dwarriden stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 350 pounds. Your size is Medium.
- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.
- **Darkvision.** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
- **Hunch.** Your stone exoskeleton gives you natural armor, making your AC begin at 12 instead of 10. You also have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.
- **Mending.** Your heritage gives you access to the ancient art of Mending. You always have access to the Mending cantrip, and you may also restore magic to an item that lost it.
- **Runic Rites.** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of magical stonework, runic crafting, or the source of magic, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.
- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Tradespeak and Rûngar. Rûngar is a slow and meticulous language of grunts and vibrations, and Dwarriden tend to carry these traits into other languages they (seldom) learn.
