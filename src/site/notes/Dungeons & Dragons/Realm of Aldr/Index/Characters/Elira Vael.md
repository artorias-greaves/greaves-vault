***Priest of Tir***

**Elira Vael** (also known as **Liar of Ale**) is a devout [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Races/Tiragardian\|Tiragardian]] cleric who, alongside the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Factions/Inquisition\|Inquisition]], seeks to restore the order of the old empire. He ventured into the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Outer Bailey/Guild/Blighted Burg\|Blighted Burg]] to deliver the healing of his [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Gods of the Realm/Tir\|god]] to its inhabitants.
# Physical Characteristics
---
Tall and heroic, with a wide frame and brown hair pulled tightly into a bun. His tired eyes are shadowed by a pale and padded hood, that and his garments being frayed at the edges.
### Voice
**Herculean.** Boisterous and brave.
# Mental Characteristics
---
Like most of Tir's faithful, Elira embodies the virtues of order and lordship. He believes in a legal boundary between lord and serf. He carries on the old [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Races/Tiragardian\|Tiragardian]] codes, even if they are now just a burden. He values heroism and justice for all, and seeks zealously to aid those around him.
