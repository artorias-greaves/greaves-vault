**Guild**, also known as the **City of Guild**, or the **Golden City**, is the largest [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Races/Tiragardian\|Tiragardian]] settlement and the center of trade and shelter in the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Outer Bailey/Outer Bailey\|Outer Bailey]]. It is a gilded city tarnished by age and corruption. Once a seat of security and wealth after the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/God Wars\|God Wars]], generations of infighting and magical plagues have left the city in a crumbling state. It was a grand cosmopolitan settlement rich with art and culture. Now, it is a crumbling urban frontier filled with beggars and monsters alike.

The homeless flood the streets, crowding them to the degree that merchants have taken to the roads beyond the walls. The noble caste, de jure rulers of the city, are nowhere to be seen, tucked warmly in their pompous palaces. Murderers and bandits have taken control, operating from a second city on the rooftops.
# Description
---
This city is made primarily of massive golden buildings and dense streets that are shadowed by arched rooftops and hooded figures. Its structures are lustrous enough to illuminate parts of the streets, even at night.

Guild is made up into tiers, with the physically lower portions of the city housing the lower stratum of its localized society, and the higher tiers—carefully quarantined from the rest—containing all of its dormant leadership.
# Geography
---
Guild is located on the plains of the Outer Bailey, a distance from the foothills of nearby mountains that provide it a source of fresh water.

# Government
---
## Senate of Seven
The 'rightful' government of Guild is a council of seven elected officials who are voted in by the most wealthy and influential families residing in the upper wards of the city. These officials convene to dictate trade, martial, and social policy to their citizens; often greedy and self-serving.

Since the spread of [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Burg Rot\|Burg Rot]], access to these portions of the city have been closed off, and these leaders are nowhere to be found. No more policies are dictated, and government is at a stand-still.
## Noosemen
With the absence of the senate, one bandit clan has risen to prominence. The [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Factions/Noosemen\|Noosemen]] have all but wrestled control of the city, operating from its rooftops while the streets are flooded with beggars and monsters.
