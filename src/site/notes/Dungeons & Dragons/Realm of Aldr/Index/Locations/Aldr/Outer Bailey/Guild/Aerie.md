The **Aerie** is a ramshackle wooden keep built atop a crumbling guard tower. It is the headquarters of the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Factions/Noosemen\|Noosemen]]. Once a beacon of safety, now it is a symbol of oppression and unease in the city of [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Outer Bailey/Guild/Guild\|Guild]].

The Aerie is made of multiple levels that provide an intensive advantage for its inhabitants, who are well-disciplined archers, duelists, and sappers. They have repurposed the ruins for defense and residence, reinforcing what they can with scavenged wood and metal to create a labyrinth of walkways, platforms, and blind cornersâ€”streets above the city.

Ropes sway all throughout the Aerie and its vast, interconnected platforms, some used for hangings, some for training, and others for travel.
