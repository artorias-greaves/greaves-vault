**Longkeep** is a minor settlement in the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Outer Bailey/Outer Bailey\|Outer Bailey]]. 

It has a population of 29 that is loosely heralded by [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Characters/Gormander\|Gormander]].
# Description
---
Like most things in the Outer Bailey, Longkeep is a derelict ruin, collecting rust, dust, and blood in the shadow of its former glory. It is a settlement out of necessity; indeed, while the number of habitable shelters may be counted on one hand, Longkeep's strategic location makes it a vital settlement for resupply on the journey out of the southern province.
# Geography
---
Longkeep is located on the edge of the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Outer Bailey/Bleakweald\|Bleakweald]]: An expansive deadwood that harries travelers as harshly as lances. 

Longkeep's long keep is (or was) located atop a small knoll, while the hamlet below fills a dry, rolling field.
# Culture
---
The survivors of Longkeep are aggressive and slow to trust, likely due to the misfortune that befalls their budding settlement. Many settlers are openly hostile to magics aside from [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Magic#Grace\|Grace]].

# History
---
After the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/God Wars\|God Wars]], survivors from [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Outer Bailey/Guild/Guild\|Guild]] settled in the ruins of Longkeep and began to work its nearby resources. A time later, the inhabitants of this budding hamlet began to experience strange dreams and, rarely, disappearances. When the herald's daughter went missing, he sought the help of the party to bring her back in return for vital supplies.
