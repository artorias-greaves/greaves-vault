**Longkeep** is a minor settlement in the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Outer Bailey/Outer Bailey\|Outer Bailey]]. 

It has a population of 29 that is loosely heralded by [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Characters/Gormander\|Gormander]].
# Description
---
Like most things in the Outer Bailey, Longkeep is a derelict ruin, collecting rust, dust, and blood in the shadow of its former glory. It is a settlement out of necessity; indeed, while the number of habitable shelters may be counted on one hand, Longkeep's strategic location makes it a vital settlement for resupply on the journey north.
# Geography
---
Longkeep is located on the edge of the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Outer Bailey/Bleakweald\|Bleakweald]]: An expansive forest that harries travelers as harshly as lances. Longkeep's long keep is (or was) located atop a small knoll, while the hamlet below fills a rolling field.
# Culture
---
The survivors of Longkeep are aggressive and slow to trust, likely due to the misfortune that befalls their budding settlement. Many settlers are openly hostile to magics aside from [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Magic#Grace\|Grace]].
