Nobody knows precisely where the **Nightgaunt** came from, only that it arrived from beyond the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Ehb\|Ehb]]. It is a shadowy, incorporeal form with a ravenous hunger for [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Species/Tiragardian\|Tiragardian]] flesh, appearing in the darkest of places that are touched by the night sky. It is thought to be the creation of [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Outer Influences/Torrid\|Torrid]]: The god’s twisted will made manifest in the realm. The Nightgaunt is capable of moving through solid objects and cannot be harmed by any known means.

The Nightgaunt's greatest weakness is light. It cannot tolerate its presence, lurking instead on the flickering border of a campfire’s glow, waiting for the embers to fade so it can strike.
