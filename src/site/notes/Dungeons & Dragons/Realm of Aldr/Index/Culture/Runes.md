When the world was young, dwelling in creation, the music of the universe had such raw potential that its influence could be felt in abstract markings that covered all things, from rocks to trees, streams to clouds. Over time this energy faded, leaving lasting marks in one the most widespread and durable forms of matter: Stone.

The most commonly traded currency in the realm are fragments of these 'runed' stones, typically mined from the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Tiragard/Warded Walls\|Warded Walls]] surrounding [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Tiragard/Tiragard\|Tiragard]]. They possess inert magic and writings from the time of [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Outer Influences/Anwe\|The Maker]] that runesmiths can decode and harness. The value of one rune against another is determined by a number of factors, the pertinent of which include overall size of stone, lingering magical potential (mana), and how many runes may actually be deciphered from the stone.

> [!NOTE]
> Practically, this means that possessing a value of 300 runes does not necessarily indicate that you are holding three-hundred separate stones. This may be one large runestone, a handful of smaller stones, or anything in between. For gameplay purposes, runes have no weight.

These stones (referred to as **runed stones**, **runestones**, or simply **runes**) can be found naturally in pockets underground, and makes up the bedrock of [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Coliseum/Coliseum\|Coliseum]]â€”The Underworld. The Warded Walls were made using runestone, and some suggest that other ancient Tiragardian structures may have been made with runestone as well. Due to its value, if they once existed, most have likely been dismantled.

Instead of a currency, **gold** is used as a resource used in crafting, alchemy, and ritual. It is often associated with the demigods [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Demigods/Chem\|Chem]] and [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Demigods/Midastopheles\|Midastopheles]]. The city of Guild features many buildings and decorations made with gold.
# Runesmiths & Mending
---
Runesmiths use ancient magics to make full use of runes. An apprentice runesmith can use runes to cast specific spells or make minor conjurations, but a skilled practitioner can enchant weapons, create magical scrolls, and ward armor and shields from attacks.

Most runesmiths possess the ability to enchant weapons, armor, and artifacts by consuming runes. Likewise, they may also disenchant magical items to recover runes from within. The most fundamental of these enchantments renders the item immune to the forces of time, nature, and force; a sword that does not dull or rust.

[[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Races/Dwarriden\|Dwarriden]] make exceptional runesmiths. All Dwarriden possess the gift of Mending: An ancient, cosmic art from [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Outer Influences/Anwe\|The Maker]] that can restore any item to its intended condition by consuming the mana within runes.
