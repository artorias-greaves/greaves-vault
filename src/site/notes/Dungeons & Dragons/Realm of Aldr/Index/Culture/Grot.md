**Grot** is a commonly consumed beverage in the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Outer Bailey/Outer Bailey\|Outer Bailey]]. It consists of a mash of rotted or fermented grains, fruit, and other, often suspect sources of sugar. The resulting suspension is commonly alcoholic, and its potency varies wildly from batch to batch. 

While Grot is a favorite amongst the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Undeath\|Undead]], living [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Species/Tiragardian\|Tiragardians]] might find the drink repulsive.

# Living Grot
---
A unique type of Grot emerged at some point following the migration of the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Species/Ylvari\|Ylvari]]. It is a fast-fermenting, mildly alcoholic drink that boosts morale and restores strength. Some claim this so-called *Living Grot* is capable of mending wounds and curing ailments in higher concentrations.

> [!NOTE] 5th Edition
> *Living Grot* is the realm's equivalent to Potions of Healing.
> 
> Once during a short or long rest, so long as you have access to a water source, you may refill your Living Grot.
> 
> The maximum number of charges and potency of your Living Grot can be improved by visiting Grottenders and finding unique ingredients scattered throughout the realm. 
> 
> Some ingredients can even bestow special effects upon your grot.

To make Living Grot, one must use an existing source. Once a container has held this type of grot, however, it is simple to use it to make a new batchâ€”as if the cup were infected, hence Living Grot's name.
