Grot is a commonly consumed beverage in the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Outer Bailey/Outer Bailey\|Outer Bailey]]. It consists of a mash of fermented grains, fruit, and other, often suspect sources of sugar. The resulting suspension is commonly made alcoholic, and its potency varies wildly from batch to batch.

While Grot is a favorite amongst the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Undeath\|Undead]], some living [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Races/Tiragardian\|Tiragardians]] find the drink repulsive.

Examples of so-called 'unconventional' ingredients often found in Grot:
- Blighted crops.
- Rotted fruit.
