# Tiragardian Dialects
---
## Imperial Common
Known by most [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Races/Tiragardian\|Tiragardians]], this language reflects the ancient dialect of the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Tiragard/Tiragard\|old empire]] after the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/God Wars\|God Wars]]. It shares many traits with its mother tongue, but sounds broken and harsh to the listener. Generally short words frequently contracted together.
## High Common
The ancient language of the first Tiragardians. It is a rare, high-spoken language, fit for a race of kings and warriors. To know this language is to be well read, privileged of birth, or an inhabitant of the old empire.
## Sarnic
The language of the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Sarnica\|Sarnicans]], [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Gods of the Realm/Sarn\|Sarn]], and the foundation for the language of demons. Sarnic is associated with dark magics and untrustworthy warlocks. Be mindful of who you speak this language around.
## Tradespeak
Another language most Tiragardians are fluent in; Tradespeak is a very simple language—based on Imperial Common—that has evolved from the frustrated questions and replies from merchants who did not know each other's languages. It has been adopted by most other races, bridging communication throughout the realm. 

However effective it may be, Tradespeak is incredibly rudimentary, and lacks the ability to convey complex ideas.
# Other Languages

## Runic
The written language of [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Outer Influences/Anwe\|Anwe]], inscribed in the runestones that make up the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Tiragard/Warded Walls\|Warded Walls]] and used to communicate with the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Inner Influences/Inner Influences\|younger gods]]. The language of creation itself, but very rarely are samples found as full letters.

**Rûngar.** The language of the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Races/Dwarriden\|Dwarriden]]. This ancient language is presented as a collection of rumbles and vibrations, thought to be the vocalizations of the realm's runes.
## Ylven
The language of the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Races/Ylvari\|Ylvari]].
