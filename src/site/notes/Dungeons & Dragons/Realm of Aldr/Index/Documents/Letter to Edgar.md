Edgar,

This so-called city of gold is a rogue's dream. The nobles sleep while we run the streets. They bury their dead in unguarded crypts with their most prized things. These tunnels must go on for miles.

Meet me here, Edgar. Find me amongst the Noosemenâ€”They are lethal, but one ought to know where to find me.

To catch their attention . . .
