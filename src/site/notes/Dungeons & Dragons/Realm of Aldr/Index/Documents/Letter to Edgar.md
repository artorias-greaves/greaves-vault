Edgar,

This so-called [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Outer Bailey/Guild/Guild\|city of gold]] is a rogue's dream. The nobles sleep while we run the streets. They bury their dead in unguarded crypts with their most prized things. These tunnels must go on for miles.

Meet me here, Edgar. Find me amongst the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Factions/Noosemen\|Noosemen]]—They are lethal, but one ought to know where to find me.

To catch their attention . . .
