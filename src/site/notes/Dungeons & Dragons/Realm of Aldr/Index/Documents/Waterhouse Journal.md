**The Hunt for Galifax, Day 21**

This cellar is safe. I think. It's unbelievably cold in here, but it's not the chill that has us trembling. The dragon is still out there. We can smell its breath fill the tower. When it growls, it shakes the ground.

It took Alga. Stupid, reckless Alga. He tried reasoning with it like a bard in some tale. Instead, he was made a loud and gory meal.

[[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Characters/Kas\|Kas]] hasn't spoken since. He sits by the stairs, sharpening his dagger over and over, even though we both know it's useless. I want to comfort him, but what is there to say? At least he might come back to life at dawn if he's bestedâ€”what's more is that he won't die when this food runs out.

**The Hunt for Galifax, Day 23**

We've been silent for days. I can hear still its claws scraping the stone above.

Kas looks restless. I think he's planning an escape.
