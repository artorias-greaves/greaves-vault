As decreed by the Horned God, the confused brother Edgar, who was last seen operating in the city of Guild as an agent to the local Noosemen, is to be found and returned to Westharbor *unharmed*.

He has employed a bodyguard, an unknown Tiragardian male who wields offensive magic. This man shall be spared for questioning.

Any parties acting in discordance to this degree will be found guilty and sentenced to exile.

â€” V.
