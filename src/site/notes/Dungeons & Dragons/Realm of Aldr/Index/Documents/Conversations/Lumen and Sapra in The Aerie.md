**Lumen:** I have told you, girl, it does not work that way. I can abate this [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Burg Rot\|plague]] of [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Gods of the Realm/Sarn\|Sarn]], but I cannot cure it. For all the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Factions/Inquisition\|Inquisition]] has come to know: Your fate is sealed.

**Sapra:** Alas.

*Sapra stands up and takes [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Artifacts/Bloodletter\|Bloodletter]] to hand.*

**Lumen:** \[Pauses\]. Your [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Factions/Noosemen\|Noosemen]] are a valuable resource; we know for certain the rot is coming from the catacombs. If we might find its sourceâ€”

**Sapra:** You are dismissed, Lumen, Last Light of Tir.
