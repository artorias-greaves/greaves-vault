These gods are best described as worldly forces of nature. They play a passive role in stewarding the realm itself. The Inner Influences inhabit the realm as physical beings, and may more readily be contacted than the Outer Influences. They are commonly referred to as the Ancients, or Old Gods.

They are very similar in concept to the Titans from Greek mythology.
