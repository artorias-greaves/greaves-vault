# Description
---
Chem's form is a massive red dragon with six eyes. His scales are bright, teeth ground sharp, and wings untatteredâ€”with a span that could cover an entire town. Chem is often seen clutched to the tallest tower in Sorcerest with his head inside the study.
# Personality
---
Chem is chaotic in nature, but he is not necessarily destructive; this dragon is deeply curious about the world he inhabits. It is almost by habit that he collects and mixes reagents for the sake of experimentation. Indeed, Chem is one of the most learned beings in the realm. He is intelligent enough to know what he is capable of, and how to best bide that strength.

A servant of chaos, Chem serves the will of Sarn. He does this with unwavering loyalty, but he isn't afraid to step on the god's toes when he gets out of line.
# Realm
---
Chem's realm is the Academy of Sorcerest. It is a prestigious, city-sized school, located within the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Tiragard/Warded Walls\|Warded Walls]], that teaches its students the mysteries of the gods and the realms. Some of the realm's most powerful mages and inventers studied here.

Chemists revere Alchemies as if they were divine objects.
