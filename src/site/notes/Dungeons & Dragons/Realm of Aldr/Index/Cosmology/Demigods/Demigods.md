Demigods are begins of immense power and will, often sufficient in strength to rival the gods themselves. They are either the vassals, consorts, or offspring of the gods, or achieved their ability through sheer will or other supplanted means. They are accounted less as godlike beings and more as heroes (or monsters) of legend, or mysterious creatures that don't fall under the prior categories.
