**Midastopheles** is a demigod often associated with drunkenness, celebrations, fermentation, and gambling. He appears as simple [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Species/Tiragardian\|Tiragardian]] man; a generous deal-maker who is willing to grant people great boons for seemingly insignificant sacrifices—but be sure to read the fine print.

Midastopheles is a name celebrated by ancient cults, but most people confronted with the god do not realize who he is. He is referred to simply as someone who appeared when something was needed most. He is a god of mysterious ambitions, abilities, and origins.

# Description
---
Midastopheles takes the form of a simple Tiragardian man with few discernable traits. He appears in a wide variety of settings, but reliably amongst gamblers, festival-goers, in taverns, and areas of expression and debauchery.
# Personality
---
This god has a jovial and humorous manner that hides an evil and traitorous soul. Midastopheles intentionally binds Tiragardians to his will with all manner of temptations, then later makes impossible demands of his 'followers'. In the moment, however, he could be your best friend.
# Realm
---
Mirrors are the realm that Midastopheles inhabits. It is a black void with scattered mirror-faces that the god may view and emerge from.
# Worship
---
It is a strangely devout or deeply learned person who seeks out Midastopheles—or someone who has not yet seen the downside to his patronage.
