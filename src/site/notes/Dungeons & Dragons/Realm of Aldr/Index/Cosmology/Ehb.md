The **Ehb**, controlled by [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Gods of the Realm/Phoheida\|Phoheida]], is the domain of the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Outer Influences/Third Will\|Third Will]] and the birthplace of contemporary [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Magic\|magic]]. It is a realm that exists parallel to this one, within and without, and exerts a continuous influence over it. It was conjoined with the realm following the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/God Wars\|God Wars]] in a cataclysm that affected the whole known world, allowing many alien and unnatural creatures to dwell within, such as [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Races/Ylvari\|Ylvari]], [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Monsters/Nightgaunt\|Nightgaunts]], and [[Ulv\|Ulv]]. 

Alongside this event also came Ehb magic, or Ehbing. [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Races/Tiragardian\|Tiragardians]] harnessed this primordial force, and the first wizards were born (within the realm—Ylvari had long-since mastered Ehbing).

Access to the Ehb as a realm remains possible through a range of different methods, most of which involve the use of portals— though the Ehb is typically encountered by accident. Getting lost in a forest, stepping into a fairy ring, or walking through a door that was not there before are all frequently reported portals into the Ehb.

Ylvari may apparently access the Ehb at will, and have a connection to it that grants them an innate sense of direction and eliminates the need for sleep.
