These gods are so-named due to their mysterious and distant nature. Their will is eternally present and unseen; they are better described as universal forces rather than as active deities. They have no avatar or skillset that's immediately discernable to the inhabitants of the realm. Instead, denizens rely on ancient stories and vague observations to divine the aspects of these foreign gods.
