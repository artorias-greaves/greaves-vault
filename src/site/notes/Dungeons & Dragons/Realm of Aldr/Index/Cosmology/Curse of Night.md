> "Let the fire burn, or the darkness consume you."

As an outcome of the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/God Wars\|God Wars]], the cycle of day and night was established. While the former was the natural state of things before, the latter carried with it a host of deadly changes that forever altered the realm.

When the curse first came, entire settlements were wiped from the map. The realm's inhabitants were unprepared for the horrors that came with night; counted among the vast majority of survivors were those who already lived in fortified cities and keepsâ€”now islands in a sea of chaos. The dead rise from their graves. Ghouls and revenants, evil sorcerers, and paladins of indiscriminate oaths all appear, laying waste to anything the darkness can touch. 

The most prominent change that night brings is the appearance of the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Monsters/Nightgaunt\|Nightgaunt]]: A formless entity (or entities) that preys on [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Races/Tiragardian\|Tiragardians]] who have been left in the dark. There is no known way to combat this creature; light merely keeps it at bay.

Most cultures have adapted to these changes. For example, Tiragardians rarely stray from light. Settlements are well-lit, with near total coverage; they are innately afraid of the dark, and thus tend to worship its opposites: Light and fire. Crowded cities are preferred to towns and villages, which may lack the resources to combat the night and all of its horrors.
