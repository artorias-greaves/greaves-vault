**Sarn** is the realm's god of lies, chaos, war, and seduction. Before the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/God Wars\|God Wars]], he was [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Tiragard/Tiragard\|Tiragard]]'s top general and aided [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Gods of the Realm/Tir\|Tir]] in his rebellion before betraying him, claiming the power of a god for himself by slaying another. This caught the attention of [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Gods of the Realm/Phoheida\|Phoheida]], who made him her consort.

# Description
---
Sarn is recorded to inhabit the realm in a wide variety of forms, though they are most commonly fair-faced, soft-spoken male or female Tiragardians. They commonly wear black cloaks or an obsidian [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Artifacts/Sarnican Masque\|Sarnican Masque]]. None of these forms of Sarn make sound when they move, nor do they leave a trail. He can be seen with or without horns.
## Avatar: The Horned God
Sarn's divine body is the king of demons: A monstrous Tiragardian with flowing hair, black horns, and a terrifying visage. He embodies the spirit of demons seen in the clouds of Hellpowder smoke. Every movement he makes is accompanied with the sound of rattling chains.
# Personality
---
This god is known for his quiet, calculated scheming. He is willing to take blows and be forced to retreat, knowing the greater strategy will always carry him to victory. He is a master manipulator who pulls the strings from behind the scenes, seeking to usurp the realm and reshape it in his image.
# Realm
---
Sarn's realm is the titularly named hellish empire of Sarnica. It is a nation of smoke, lies, and constant surveillance. Ruthless tyranny, unstable technologies, and black magics are all staples of Sarnican society.

# Worship
---
Sarn is worshipped by all Sarnicans, and some Tiragardians beyond in secret sects. The bloody rites of this god are reviled by most, yet others see them as part of the natural order, intended by the Outer Influences. The core tenants of the cult of Sarn involve sacred murder, struggle and submission, witchcraft, and ritual dreaming.
## Rituals
The spirit of Sarn can be invoked by igniting Hellpowder or by one Tiragardian spilling the blood of another. Altars to Sarn participate in blood sacrifice to contact the dark god and hear his will.
## Sarnhari
The Sarnhari, or Whores of Sarn, is a devilish cabal that heeds the chaos god's call, working behind the scenes to unravel the world in preparation for his new order. They are harbingers of great plagues, curses, and dark sorceries.
