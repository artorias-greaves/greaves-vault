**Tir** is the realm's god of light, time, and order. He was a great warrior who carved civilization into the world and commanded obedience from its inhabitants. His ambitions gained the ire of the gods, who imprisoned him beneath the world and cursed it with the cycle of time and the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Curse of Night\|Curse of Night]]. 

Tir was the catalyst for the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/God Wars\|God Wars]].

**Title(s)**
- The Lord-Sun
- The Scorching Sinner
- The Dying God

**Adjective(s)**
- Tiragardian
# Description
---
Tir appears as a crucified man, the left half of whose body is burned to the bone. He is bound by warded chains and runic stones. He may fleetingly inhabit the realm in the spirit of a great warrior.
## Avatar: The Lord-Sun
Tir's divine body is the sunâ€”his burning half, forced to make the journey across the realm of the living and through the underworld.
# Personality
---
Tir was violent, impulsive, and tyrannical, but he was also fueled by a desire to bring godhood to all of his people. The man knew moments of honor and justice, but his ambition outweighed them. He was willing to go to great lengths to achieve the power of the gods, even if it meant his own sacrifice, or the sacrifice of his people.
# Realm
---
Tir's realm is [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Coliseum/Coliseum\|Coliseum]], the underworld, where all dead Tiragardians go to fade into obscurity or rise into life after death. It is a realm of prophecies and forbidden magics that the god is forced to inhabit for his rebellion. The god resides in the palace of [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Coliseum/Rohm\|Rohm]], where he is eternally conflagrated.

# Worship
---
As expected, Tir is worshipped by most Tiragardians outside of [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Sarnica\|Sarnica]]. Those who don't, or are outright hostile towards the god, are often accused of being Sarnhari: an agent of the chaos god. The core tenants of the church of Tir involve sun and ancestor worship, armed pilgrimage, and prophecy. They wander the realm, protected from otherworldly threats by the divinity of the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Artifacts/Censure of Everburning Fire\|Censure of Everburning Fire]].
## Everburning Fire
The Everburning Fire is though to be the spirit of Tir who guides his faithful in the realm. It is a white fire that does not burn those who are truly devoted to the Scorching Sinner. It can be seen 'pulling' in a particular direction at times, or depicting a specific symbol within the fire. The Church of Tir divines these anomalies as the will of Tir made manifest.
## Rituals
The spirit of Tir can be invoked by burning the bones of fallen Tiragardians in Everburning Fire. This kindles the flame and captures the god's attention, leading to a myriad of divine interventions. Tir is best known for leading his followers with the Fire, though his path is often vague and changing.
## The Inquisition
The [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Factions/Inquisition\|Inquisition]] was first formed as an opposition to the heretical magics of Sarn, with the goal of investigating and expunging the Sarnhari and their teachings from the realm. Following the God Wars, the Inquisition remains as a hidden order that broadly retains the same goals.
