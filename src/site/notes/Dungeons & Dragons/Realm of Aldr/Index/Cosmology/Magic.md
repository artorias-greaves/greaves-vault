Magic in the realm is a set of phenomenon—some natural and some artificial, divine or secular—that cover a wide range of domains. It reflects the ability that some individuals have to manipulate the world around them in supernatural or paracausal ways (without cause and effect).
# Ehbing
---
The most common and malleable source of magic came from the Ehb alongside the arrival of the Third Will. This magic, known as the Ehb, Ehb magic, or Ehbing, can control the earth, create elements, and enable the wielder to fly—among other spectacles like evocation or necromancy. Due to its ease of access and inherent potency, the vast majority of mages in the realm practice Ehbing.

Invoking the Ehb to cast spells requires two preparations:
1.  Access to a magical focus, such as an enchanted item or location;
2. Ability to perform of a set of verbal and/or somatic components specific to the spell.

> [!NOTE] Note
> This is the catch-all domain of magic that might exist in a typical game of Dungeons & Dragons. It is capable of all of the feats of the other sources, and encompasses all schools (such as conjuration or necromancy) and damage types (such as fire or psychic). It is a creative domain, and so players may flavor spellcasting however they wish.

The Ehb can be manipulated to produce imitations of the other forms of magic—superior in most ways, as they no longer require rituals—but rune magic remains unique to Dwarriden and those learned in the craft.
# Fetish
---
Darkness, manipulation, and destruction. This domain of magic, called Fetish magic or Fetishism is reviled by [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Species/Tiragardian\|Tiragardians]] and [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Species/Dwarriden\|Dwarriden]] alike. It carries with it the same mistrust that necromancy does in most other settings. Even in [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Sarnica/Sarnica\|Sarnica]], where this magic is revered, it is forbidden to possess knowledge of outside of the privileged castes. Practitioners of prophecy, clairvoyance, and telepathy—common faucets of Fetishism—are harassed by demonic entities that appear in dreams and trance.

# Grace
---
The guiding, judicial light of [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Gods of the Realm/Tir\|Tir]] (also called the **Grace of Tir**, or the **Sun's Grace**), is the primary source of radiant magic in the realm. This magic is thought to come from the sun—the god's divine body—and thus often appears as a blinding light or white fire. It may guide the faithful on a particular path or towards a destination. To its invoker, this magic tends to uplift the spirit, clearing thoughts and boosting morale. To its enemies, this magic burns and convicts, compels truthful speech, and harries movement.
> [!NOTE] 5th Edition Equivalents
> - Radiant damage type.
> - Divine sense and sacred oaths.
> - Healing Word, Bless, Spirit Guardians, etc.
# Runics
---
Runics, or rune magic, is magic that is most commonly tied to objects rather than elements or forces. It comes from the inherently divine nature of the world, especially so in the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Culture/Runes\|stones]] that the gods used to make the walls that surrounded their kingdom. 

These runestones, or runes, could be manipulated by said gods to change into various shapes and bestow certain properties—an ancient art recalled by Dwarriden. Contemporarily, it is used to create magical artifacts, bestow enchantments, and in the construction of warded structures.
