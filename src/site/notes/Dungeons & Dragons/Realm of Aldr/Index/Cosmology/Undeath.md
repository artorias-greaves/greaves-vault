Undeath in the realm takes many forms, ranging from a divine mold to a cursed dynasty.
# Burg Rot
---
The [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Burg Rot\|Burg Rot]] began to spread in densely populated areas at some point after the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/God Wars\|God Wars]]. This undead is a mindless, sensationless void in which souls are left in the Cauldron, but the body is wretched under Sarn's control.
# House of the Sun
---
Members of the House of the Sun enjoy a long life and even life after deathâ€”but frequent death or excessive aging results in the loss of regular bodily functions and decline of mental faculties. This form of undeath has a number of afflictions and stipulations; it is a curse, to many, more than it is a blessing.
# Ehbing
---
Necromantic magic sourced from the Ehb can have many effects, some resembling symptoms of Burg Rot or Tir's cursed lineage, but wholly separate in origin. The dead raised with Ehb magic tend to be mindless servants, entrapped by the will of a nearby necromancer.
