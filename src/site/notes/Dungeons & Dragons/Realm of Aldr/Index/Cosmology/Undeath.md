Undeath in the realm takes many forms, ranging from a divine mold to a cursed dynasty.
# Burg Rot
---
The [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Burg Rot\|Burg Rot]] began to spread in densely populated areas at some point after the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/God Wars\|God Wars]]. This form of undeath is the result of [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Magic#Fetish\|Fetishism]]—the magic of [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Gods of the Realm/Sarn\|Sarn]].
# House of the Sun
---
Members of the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Factions/House of the Sun\|House of the Sun]] enjoy a long life and even life after death—but frequent death or excessive aging results in the loss of regular bodily functions and decline of mental faculties. This form of undeath has a number of afflictions and stipulations; it is a curse, to many, more than it is a blessing.
# Ehbing
---
Necromantic magic sourced from the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Ehb\|Ehb]] can have many effects, some resembling symptoms of Burg Rot or [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Gods of the Realm/Tir\|Tir]]'s cursed lineage, but wholly separate in origin. The dead raised with Ehb magic tend to be mindless servants, entrapped by the will of a nearby necromancer.
