# Properties
---
**Runic.** You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

***Bolide.*** You may forego a regular melee weapon attack to instead attack any target within 30 ft.

***Massive.*** This weapon's immense size gives you a blocking surface, increasing your AC by 1 while it is wielded.

***Heavy.*** Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

***Two-Handed.*** This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Kingslayer Axe is a magical axe that once belonged to a tribal usurper. It syphons the ambient magic from nearby runestones and unleashes it upon a distant foe.
