# Properties
---
**Runic.** You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

**Finesse.** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**Reach.** This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks against it.

**Sentinel.** When wielding this weapon, you gain the following benefits:
- When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.
- Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach.
- When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature.
# Description
---
Bloodletter is a runic rapier that was created by master crafters who were kidnapped by the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Factions/Noosemen\|Noosemen]] of [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Outer Bailey/Guild/Guild\|Guild]] and coerced into work. The impressive length of its blade appears to grow and shorten depending on its wielder's will, giving it an advantage in combat.
