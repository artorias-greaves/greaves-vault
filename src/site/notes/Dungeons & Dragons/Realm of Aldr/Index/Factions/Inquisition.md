# Organization
---
The Inquisition is organized in a strict hierarchy, with each rank held subject to the authority of the rank above.

**High Inquisitor**

**Inquisitor.**

**Seeker.** The initiate rank. As a fledgling servant of Tir, your mission is to provide information and infrastructure for the higher ranks, and serve as a vanguard on the field. Seekers are the eyes and ears of Tir.
# History
---
The Inquisition was first formed as an opposition to the heretical magics of Sarn, with the goal of investigating and expunging the Sarnhari and their teachings from the realm. Following the God Wars, the Inquisition remains as a hidden order that broadly retains the same goals.
## Covert Clerics
Spies and agents make up the upper echelons of the Inquisition. They are venerable Tiragardians of great skill who oppose the Sarnhari directly, and conduct raids into Sarnica itself.
