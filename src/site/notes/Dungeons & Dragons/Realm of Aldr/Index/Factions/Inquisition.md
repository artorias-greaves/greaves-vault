The **Inquisition**, also known as **Tir's Inquisition**, or the **Church of Tir**, is a religious order centered around the worship, protection, and adherence to the god [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Gods of the Realm/Tir\|Tir]] and his followersâ€”as well as the detection, investigation, and removal of all [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Factions/Sarnhari\|Sarnhari]] influence from the realm. It began as a political and religious dogma intended to identify heretics and dissenters amongst the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Races/Tiragardian\|Tiragardians]], and later developed into a church and formal religion.

# Organization
---
The Inquisition is organized in a strict hierarchy, with each rank held subject to the authority of the rank above. Following the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/God Wars\|God Wars]], they are scattered across the realm, decentralized, but still zealous to their cause.

**Burning Bishop.** The Burning Bishops are the ecumenical leaders of the Inquisition. They are the ancient priests who counseled Tir before the God Wars. Now, they guide the god's faithful to unknown ends.

**Inquisitor.** A mysterious and secretive caste who are seldom seen, much less spoken to. They are deft combatants and wielders of [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Cosmology/Magic#Grace\|Grace]], and legend tells of their intense methods of interrogation.

**Seeker.** The initiate rank. As fledgling servants of Tir, their mission is to provide information and infrastructure to the higher ranks, and serve as a vanguard on the field. Seekers are the eyes and ears of Tir. They obtain their instructions through ritual contact with the Burning Bishops through their [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Artifacts/Censure of Grace\|holy censures]].
## Covert Clerics
Spies and agents make up the upper echelons of the Inquisition. They are venerable Tiragardians of great skill who oppose the Sarnhari directly, and conduct raids into Sarnica itself.
# History
---
The Inquisition was first formed as political opposition to the heretical magics of Sarn, with the goal of investigating and expunging the Sarnhari and their teachings from the realm. Following the God Wars, the Inquisition remains as a hidden order that broadly retains the same goals.
## House of the Sun
The Inquisition is broadly composed of agents of the [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Factions/House of the Sun\|House of the Sun]]: Tir's cursed bloodline. These are immortal Tiragardians who succumb to higher madness with the passing of time and spilling of blood.
