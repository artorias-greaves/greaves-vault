The **Noosemen** are bandits that occupy the rooftops of [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Locations/Aldr/Outer Bailey/Guild/Guild\|Guild]], forming their own shanty town above the rabble. They use an intricate system of scaffolds and jumping platforms to navigate the dense city with ease, escaping pursuers and chasing prey. They are ruthless thieves and murderers. The Noosemen all but control the city. Beggars act as their eyes. Merchants pay tribute. The nobles are afraid to leave their palace. 

The Noosemen have taken advantage of the spreading rot by plundering the tombs of dead kings for their weapons and riches, further cementing their control of the city.

They wield crossbows at range, and a rapier paired with a parry dagger in melee.

**Motto**
No kings, only men.

**Membership**
Deserters, murderers, fences, thieves, bards.
Must be endorsed by existing clanmate to join.

# Organization
---
The Noosemen consists solely of male and female [[Dungeons & Dragons/Realm of Aldr/Index/Species/Tiragardian\|Tiragardians]]. Each Nooseman wears a tattered hood and noose around their neck, which is used both as identification and rhetoric.
## Leadership
They are led by an articulate and dangerous rogue called Sapra.
## Activities
The Noosemen are engaged in a wide variety of criminal activities within the city of Guild. They are the de facto rulers of the city, as its current wardens have long since locked themselves in their palace. They engage in robbery, intimidation, murder, and subterfuge as a means to further cement their power in the golden city.
# History
---
## A Clan of Bards
The Noosemen were first formed from a traveling artisan trope—actors, poets, and bards—that settled in Guild to enjoy its rich culture as the premier trading hub. After the God Wars and subsequent collapse of order, these clever Tiragardians turned to swindling, and the bardic arts quickly garnered a reputation for its seedy and manipulative participants.

Many generations later, this bandit clan still holds its traditions and prejudices. They communicate sensitive information using subtle notes from a flute, and are often found playing somber melodies when at rest.
