# Ingredients
---
To make 1 gallon of mead:
- 2 lbs. wildflower honey, raw
- Clean water, bottled or filtered
- 2.5g wine yeast
- 1g DAP nutrient (optional)
# Tools
---
- Sanitizer
- Glass carboy
- Hydrometer
- Airlock & bung
# Steps
---
1. Add honey and water. Mix.
2. Take hydrometer reading.
3. Add yeast. Mix.
4. Add yeast nutrient. Mix.
5. Seal and store for 24 hours.
6. Back sweeten for taste or ABV (add more honey/sugars).
7. Store until done fermenting (~21 days).
8. Let mead age longer for taste and clarity.
9. Bottle after 1-2 months minimum.
# Notes
---
## Batch 1
- Slow start to fermenting (~3 days).
- No strong smells (Liam's was toxic).
- Day 15: Still tastes very sweet. **Very slight** burn of alcohol.
- **Notes:**
	- Fermentation slowed to a crawl near the end. Use nutrients next time? More sugar?
	- Use a hydrometer to determine accurate ABV.
## Batch 2
- Quick start to fermentation, even before adding nutrients.
- Starting Gravity of 1.18(?)
- Added way too much nutrient about 16 hours after mix.
- Day 6: Gravity of 1.1 = 10.5% ABV. Still tastes very sweet.
- **Notes:**
	- Fermentation kicked off strong.
	- Still tasted very sweet at (probably) 10% ABV. Light carbonation, very little alcohol burn.
	- Much quicker fermentation than Batch 1, even before the addition of nutrients. Likely an issue with waking the yeast, and the quantity used. 
		- **In the future, wake your yeast properlyâ€”and use the full packet.**
