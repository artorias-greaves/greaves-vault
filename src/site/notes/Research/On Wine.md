Wines are typically named after the type of grape the wine is made from, or the location and/or technique in which it was made.

**White Wine**
- Best served chilled (10-15 degrees).

**Red Wine**
- Served at room temperature.
- Let sit for a few minutes to oxidize, or decant to aerate.

**Mead** (Honey Wine)
- Served at any temperature.
- The better your honey, the better your mead.
- Prefer unpasteurized and unfiltered honey (Costco/Great Value honey does work, however).
# How long should you age your wine?
---
- As long as it takes.
- As ABV increases, the length of aging should increase.
- Age helps round out flavor, make it less assaulting.
- Alcohol burn lessens.
- 6-12 months minimum depending on ABV.
- Wholly subjective.
# Primary & Secondary Fermentation
---
**Primary:** Occurs in the first 1-60 days of wine's life. The stage in which most of the sugar is consumed.
- Visually apparent. Once bubbles have slowed, 1-3 minutes per bubble (or no bubblesâ€”presumably in airlock).
- 7-21 days is an ideal minimum.
- Can theoretically ferment a maximum ABV product (~16-18%) in 24 hours.
	- Would require specific (turbo) yeast and proper conditions.

**Secondary:** Following primary fermentation until the wine is racked.
- In this stage you may:
	- Add extra ingredients, back sweeten.
	- Halt or resume fermentation according to recipe.
	- Rack, age, or consume.
# Terms
---
- **Backsweeten.** To add flavor (typically sweet) to wine after its initial sugar has been consumed. For example, adding honey to a dry mead.
- **Cold Crash.** One method of pausing fermentation, allowing the yeast to settle in the fermentation vessel. To perform a cold crash, refrigerate your wine for 1-3 days. To restart fermentation, bring your vessel back to normal temperature and provide yeast nutrients.
- **Dryness.** A dry wine has had most or all of its initial sugar content removed by fermentation. You will still taste fruit (or honey, etc.), but it will not be sweet.
- **Racking.** Moving wine from one vessel to another, typically from a vat and into bottles after fermentation has finished or been halted. Done to remove sediment and clarify the liquid.
