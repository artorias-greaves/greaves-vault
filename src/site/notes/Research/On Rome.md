# Origins of Latium

3 Interpretations:
1. **Mythological.** Comes from the word 'to be hidden'. This connection is made to Roman religion: Saturn is fleeing from Jupiter, so he hides in the region. Also may connect to the original inhabitants living in caves, hidden from Jupiter's gaze.
2. **Geographical.** The Italian peninsula features many dipping hills, valleys, and mountains that easily conceal the view beyond. The word 'to be hidden' could refer to, in a literal sense, the Latins' perspective of the valley where Rome was settled.
	- Could originate from word Latus, meaning a broad or spacious place or region.
3. **Proto-Latin.** May be synonymous with a proto-Latin term for swamp or reed land.
