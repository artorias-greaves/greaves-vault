Struggling their way through a dark and cramped cave, Eleanor and Maverick establish a plan to steal a dragon's scale in order to achieve fire magic. Eleanor can see in the dark, but she is a frail old woman. Maverick, while he can traverse the area more readily, must rely on torch light, and is ultimately slowed by Eleanor, to whom he seems loyal by aiding her steps.

They navigate the cave. The plan is for Eleanor to distract the dragon while Maverick, using invisibility magic, plucks a scale from the dragon. Maverick then will use teleportation to bring them both to safety—after all, the less magic Eleanor uses, the less of her soul will be consumed (and her eyes). Therefore it is best for Maverick to do the casting, as his type of magic, while weaker than Eleanor's, does not have such a negative cost.

Eleanor is convinced of approach. Maverick goes invisible, and Eleanor enters the dragon's lair and starts a dialogue with the creature. Maverick reaches the dragon, but Eleanor wants to talk more with it—and she can't signal to Maverick to wait due to distance. 

Maverick plucks the scale according to plan, enraging the dragon and triggering a cave-in.

They escape the cave, but the dragon is gone, and Eleanor is upset: Maverick explains to Eleanor that he was just following the plan. It was a good distraction and he acted when he needed to ensure success. 

Eleanor saw a long-term reward that may be greater than overt power. If only he waited a little longer.

Maverick says that waiting longer could have cost them the plan. What if the dragon was plotting to trap Eleanor? Could she detect deception? *Would she be willing to take that risk?* If not for her, then what about Maverick?

Eleanor is convinced, and Maverick masters fire magic.
	- ==Play with this idea. Maybe Eleanor is not convinced and begins to worry about Maverick's morality, leading into a broader story.==
