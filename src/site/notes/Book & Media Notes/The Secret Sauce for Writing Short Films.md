- Pick 1 symbol to represent the character's growth:
>You should be able to mount the camera in one place and capture all you need to capture."

- Only need 1 (isolated instance) of a character representing something.
- If you know the essence of a story, you ought to be able to boil it down into a short story.
	- **Titanic:** A story about a dreamy upper-class girl who finds a man who instills a sense of self-agency, and then dies. She carries the lessons with her.
		- **Short Story:** Everyone is scrambling to get off the ship as it is sinking. We see her standing nonchalant in rich clothes. A raggedy poor guy shows up and convinces her to give life another shot and get on the boat. She does, we end on him and his death is implied.
- If you don't want to condense a novel, pick an incident from the novel and make that your short story.
