## What is Archaeology?
- Not about individual monuments or artifacts, it's about patterns.
	- Patterns make up cultures. Cultures make up civilizations.
	- Archaeology today is about analyzing large data sets over time.
	- 'High resolution data': Isotopes from ancient animals can provide information about their habitat, diet, and seasonal changes.
- Why aren't these specific data sets being looked at?
	- Funding.
	- External (environmental, political).
## Challenging the Hypothesis
Two clear disproofs:
1. **Ice Age Evidence**
	- Rogan asks how dense the research is around the world, to which Dibble replies 'thousands' of archaeological dives have been done, and that predictive models aid in finding sites.)
2. **Food**
	- Evidence of domestication.
	- Joe: Is it possible that we're dealing with a region? Possible that other areas were more advanced?
		- Many reasons as to why there couldn't be agriculture.

- Overall, Dibble wants to focus on the current evidence and see where it leads.
- "We don't usually use the term 'civilization' or 'birth of civilization' in archaeology."

### Questions for Graham
> "I think we are talking about a civilization more than 12'000 years ago which was advanced as our civilization was, say in the late 18th or early 19th century" â€” Hancock, 2019
## Conclusion
- "We publish what we find. There is no defined narrative or dogma to keep the past hidden."
# Hancock 1

- The civilization that I'm thinking about is a black hole; nebulous.
	- Emerged out of shamanism.
	- Strong sense of astronomy.
		- Knowledge of the procession of the equinox.
	- High technology:
		- The Longitude Problem.
## Clovis First Hypothesis
"I wonder if the ghost of Clovis First is not still haunting archaeology."
- Hancock here proposes that archaeologists are systematically bitter and refuse to let go of their previously established paradigms.
	- The finder of Bluefish Caves was ruined by the other archaeologists.
	- There is a chilling effect.
	- Monte Verde, Chile, Tom Dillehey
		- Got plenty of funding; exclusively North American archaeologists who were dismissive.
			- **Why is this?**
## What about the Sahara, Dibble?
Here, Hancock tries to trap Dibble with the question, "how much do you think of the Sahara has been excavated?" Dibble does not answer (because it's a useless question) and proceeds to explain that a lot of the Sahara has indeed been surveyed, and that there are thousands of hunter-gatherer findings.
- It is a useless question because the 'quality' of archeology isn't determined by the number of excavations done, or the coverage of an area. Land is surveyed and potential sites are excavated over time.

Overall, Hancock is arguing here that, due to the lack of archaeological excavations done in the Sahara desert and Amazon rainforest, this hypothesis is being systematically ruled out.
- Sahara desert
- Amazon rainforest
- Continental shelf

# Current Thoughts

Science is a language. You can't give an illiterate a set of words and expect him to compose a speech; therefore you can't just give a layman a set of facts and expect them to come to a solid conclusion. There are a series of steps and checks that are involved in the scientific and historical processes that have proven vital to the fields. By their natures, these are slow, conservative processes that tend to cling to what is 'known' because we have reached those conclusions after painstaking developments. Therefore it stands that future theories be equally painstakingly prodded before being accepted as the new 'known' thing.

- You can't just look at a thing and make a conclusion as to whether it is man-made or not. 

It is a pity how some archaeologists act to potentially new data points, but this is irrelevant to the hypothesis of Hancock's lost, advanced civilization.

Dibble is here to present evidence.

Hancock is here to say that we haven't done enough looking into certain areas to disprove his hypothesis, and this extends from a deep-rooted bigotry.

"Of course I want to see more research done into these areas. Here's how you can help fund that."
## What ABOUT the Sahara.
- Thousands of sites were surveyed in spots that were expected to contain humans.
	- Hunter-gatherer finds are ubiquitous.
	- **We go from the known into the unknown.** And all signs in doing so point to hunter-gatherers.

On shutting down ideas: Archaeology as a field is a group like any other people. There are lots of assholes.

"In what they have studied, there is no evidence for an advanced civilization."
- More on underwater rock formations.
## On Gunung Padang
- Hancock argues that the presence of a series of potential tunnels or chambers in the mountain of Gunung Padang, soil samples taken around there dating back to 20'000 years ago, is a piece of evidence in his favor.
	- The mountain of Gunung Padang is a volcano. Those are volcanic chambers. Soil samples do not imply human habitation.
- More on "Dibble's influence on media and culture". This is where the conversation devolves.
