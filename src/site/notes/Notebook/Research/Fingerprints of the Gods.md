This is an article discussing journalist **Graham Hancock** and his foundational work, *Fingerprints of the Gods* (1995) and its related hypothesis: There was a lost, global civilization that existed before the Younger Dryas period (~12'800-11'600 YBP).
> *"There was a lost, globe-spanning, advanced civilization at the end of the last ice age."* — Graham Hancock
## Preamble
**Did there exist an advanced, globe-spanning civilization at the end of the last ice age?**
## What is 'advanced'?
This is the most difficult faucet of Hancock's hypothesis to pin down. Conservatively, Hancock (and others) will simply claim that 'advanced' means 'more advanced than currently thought'. For the purposes of this article, this is the definition that is used.

~~This is a facetious description, composed with deliberate ambiguity.~~
## How do you prove a lost civilization?
- **Cultural layers.** Stratigraphic layers of soil that contain evidence for human habitation. Currently one of the most useful and reliable methods for determining mankind's presence in a given area and time period.
- **Material culture.** At this point, this evidence would likely exist in a cultural layer. Material culture refers to things like statues, distinct architecture, or tools and miscellaneous goods (such as jewelry, pottery, etc.)
- **Structural evidence.** Among our earliest known civilizations exist remnants of structures, whether that comes in the form of remaining foundations, standing structures, or historical accounts of said structures.

If there existed a civilization in this time period (12'800-11'600 YBP), *especially if it were globe-spanning*, it would be reasonable to assume that *some* of these evidences would be found by now.

## Meltwater Pulse 1B
At its zenith, the rise in sea level resulting from Meltwater Pulse 1B achieved a mere 1.7 inches (~40mm) per year. This is hardly the apocalyptic scenario that Hancock presents.

**Probably not.**

Graham Hancock (et al.), whether consciously or otherwise, engages in misleading and unscientific rhetoric that is damaging to the broader perception of history and the scientific method. He has built his entire thesis around a conclusion and actively seeks evidence that supports it, rather than proposing a hypothesis and prodding it vigorously from all sides to test for a point of failure. Fundamentally, this is not how history is studied (or how any valid hypotheses are formed). What's more is that the vast majority of Hancock's 'evidence' lies in the *god of the gaps*; that the gaps in historical understanding are indicators of this supposed lost civilization. This is a gross fallacy that underpins the entirety of Hancock's work.

Hancock does not present a single point of genuine, certifiable evidence that supports his claims. When Hancock *does* present a scenario that seems convincing to his hypothesis, one of two things becomes apparent:
1. He is incorrect about a significant faucet of said scenario;
2. He has made unreasonable leaps in logic to draw connections between the scenario and his hypothesis.

## Postscript/Personal Conclusions
Popular characters like Jimmy Corsetti and Dan Richards, alongside the alumni that fail to properly reckon with these facts, do a vast disservice to the broader perception of historians (by certification or hobby alike) who are invested in the topics of prehistoric flooding, the ice age, and humanity's place in this tumultuous time by voicing unsubstantiated claims on platforms that fail to challenge them. Their engagement in these theses, while admirable on the surface, lays fertile ground for the compounding of conspiracy theories that have no basis in fact.

> *"Goodness knows what has been lost to rising sea levels."* — Graham Hancock

These are deeply interesting topics for me: Mankind's place in the ice age and before, warming and cooling periods (Younger Dryas epoch), and the possibility of a flood (or floods) that might corelate to historical accounts (Genesis, Sumerian mythos, etc.). The rise in prominence in these so-called *alternative historians* makes genuine research into these topics difficult at best; At worst, it opens the doors for being labeled conspiracist or unscientific, thus dissuading discussion.

It sure is ~~infuriating~~ entertaining, though.

Thanks for reading.
