This is an article discussing a conversation[^1] between Adam Green, Gnostic Informant, and Uberboyo that seeks to undermine the validity of Jewish history as it is understood through the Torah.

# Preamble
---
- I'm more interested in the historical refutations and outcomes rather than the moral or theological implications—though I may delve into both.
- Ultimately, this is a theological topic with moral conclusions; both things I don't care to question or debate. My 'mission' is to explore the historicity of Judaism and Christianity as it relates to the historical claims made in the conversation.
- **Thesis:** The Torah and the stories contained within did not exist prior to c. 300 B.C. The Jewish mythology and Christianity were designed to impose a global (catholic) power structure and promote Jewish supremacy in a historical and theological context—described by the commentators as a pervasive mindset that infiltrates modern thought (i.e. Zionism).
	- The challenge: Find a reference to the Torah from before 400 B.C. 
	- Daniel, 164 B.C. and Maccabees were written at the same time.
	- The uniqueness of Jesus Christ as a deity is non-existent.
	- The Gospels were entirely fabricated (probably after Jesus' death).
	- Old and New Testaments were influenced by Plato.
	- Monogamy was inspired by northern European pagans.
	- The gap between the writing and practice of the Torah and the emergence of Christianity was between 50-150 years.

# Dating the Torah
---
- There is an important distinction between the Written Torah and the Oral, or Spoken Torah that the commentators fail to address. Rabbinic tradition dictates the Spoken Torah existed long before it was written.
	- Of course, the source for this is naturally the Jewlumni, so it will not be reckoned with.
	- It is broadly accepted that Judaism emerged *slowly* as a cult of ancient Canaanite religion, only establishing a 'proper', cultural Judaism by around 300 B.C., and contemporary Judaism by the 1st century A.D.
		- Judaism was practiced *alongside* Canaanite paganism in the Torah and in ancient Israel's archaeological record. The Prophets were very aware of this when composing the Torah.
- Though the evidence is somewhat shaky, the first reference to Israel could be from around 1200 B.C.[^4] This is around when the Bible claims these kingdoms (Israel and Judea) existed.
	- More solid evidence, dating to c. 840 B.C. contains references to Israel, Yahweh, and events that occur in the Bible's Books of Kings.[^5]
	- Historians and archaeologists generally agree that Israel and Judah both existed as separate kingdoms by c. 900 B.C. and 850 B.C. respectively.
- There is an ongoing debate as to whether or not Israel is *specifically* determined to be a Canaanite culture found that dates back to pre-tenth century B.C.
	- There is a distinct lack of pig bones found in 'Israelite' homes which may suggest pork was not consumed, in line with Biblical law, where pork is claimed to have made up about twenty percent of Levantine diet.
# Plato's Influence
---
Throughout the conversation, the commentators make the claim that the Old and New Testaments were likely influenced by Platonic teachings. This is because there are a vast number of similarities between Plato's ideas and Biblical law, as well as Plato being a contemporary figure during the alleged composing of the Torah.

This first, of course, relies on the posit that the Torah did not exist prior to the time of Plato (c. 400-300 B.C.). However, should this be the case, there existed a broader array of schools of thought that were both closer geographically to Judea and Babylon, *and* more closely reflect the laws codified in the Torah. If we push the dating of the Spoken Torah back, these potential influences expand dramatically, covering the entirety of the Levant, much of Mesopotamia, and even into the Indus Valley.
## Zoroastrianism
- Essentially Christianity + the Demiurge concept, complete with a central prophet figure, from ~200 years before Plato and probably even earlier.
	- Aligns much more closely with archaeological Israel.
## Code of Hammurabi
The Code of Hammurabi is a significant legal document from ancient Babylon which dates back to roughly 1750 B.C.. It contains many familiar concepts to the laws of the Old Testament. Even the many allusions to sheep, which the commentators claim is another inspiration drawn from Plato's work, has been a significant cultural meme for at least a thousand years prior.
> "I am Hammurabi, the shepherd, selected by the god Enlil.

It is broadly accepted by historians and archaeologists that the Code of Hammurabi was a significant influence in the Written Torah and modern western civilization.

> [!NOTE] Note
> That all being said, it is interesting to note that one of the oldest extant copies of the Ten Commandments only dates back to roughly 30 B.C.[^2]

It is much more likely that the Torah, coming from the Middle East, was influenced by *local*, contemporary philosophies, rather than those in Greece. Evidence in DNA and language suggest the bulk of evolution in Jewish culture and religion took place in the Levant, Mesopotamia, and the land between.

## On Monogamy
Monogamy has been the cultural norm in most Middle Eastern cultures since the time of Hammurabi. Ancient Mesopotamian law widely dictates that adulterous women be put to death. It is also important to note that many Germanic cultures permitted concubines, or even encouraged them as a matter of prestige.

The claim that the Abrahamic religions may have adopted monogamy through observations or integrations with northern European pagans is unlikely at best.
# Yahweh-Iconoclasm Conspiracy*
---
- The idea that Yahweh/the Jewish prime god of the time was 'constructed as a tool to enforce Zionism'; Monotheism and the iconoclasm that came with later Yahweh was a Jewish tool to promote their dogma.
- This is how most ancient religions worked. Politics and religion were indistinguishable from each other. Iconoclasm is and was a common tactic taken by the zealous and politically motivated; some cultures have attempted to wipe out entire histories of other cultures in favor of their own supremacy. This is hardly a uniquely Jewish thing.
- The world was already (very swiftly) moving towards monotheism as once-broad pantheons are trimmed down and the focus hones in on a singular god—typically the sky-father, so-called gods of war, and other paternal 'overgods'. This is evident in the ancient Egyptian cult of Aten, Enlil in ancient Sumer, Zeus in Greece,[^3] and Rome's Jupiter.

# Conclusions
---
Most of the history presented is either factually inaccurate, or it is already common knowledge among historians; the conclusions that these people thus allude to are sometimes suspect—at other times, however, they raise interesting questions, the answers to which may have frightening implications.
## A Young Religion?
The idea that Judaism is a relatively young religion is not a secret, and the commentators fail to recognize the evidence that helps historians date the transition between polytheistic Canaan and monotheistic Israel (and recognize that the distinction was blurry for a long time).
## A 'Constructed' Religion?
Of course it is.
## Societal Implications
