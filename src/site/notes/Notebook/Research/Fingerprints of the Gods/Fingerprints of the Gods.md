This is an article discussing journalist **Graham Hancock** and his recent work, *Ancient Apocalypse* (2022) and its related hypothesis: There was a global civilization that existed before the Younger Dryas period (~12'800-11'600 years before present (YBP))—referred to here as the Hancock Civilization.

# Preamble
This is a difficult topic to write about—not because the claims and evidences are so broad and complicated (thought they certainly are)—but because Hancock is not in the business of reckoning with evidence or engaging in peer review altogether. He will enter debate with the hypothesis above, then when his purported evidence is disproved as being related, he will say it is 'something that needs be looked into' or 'I do not believe this'—as if hosts of academics and laymen alike, many of whom have greater resources and established methodologies than Hancock, have not already formed their own conclusions. He will shift his angle of attack then, and instead propose an alleged tyrannical dogma that exists in the scientific community, and is implicit in the broader lack of evidence.

It is for these reasons that, while the Hancock Civilization is the primary subject of this article, it will delve also into claims of this alleged bigotry, and bring light to Graham's ideology.

> *"I am trying to overthrow the paradigm of history."* — Graham Hancock

It should go without saying that this article is **not** composed out of hatred for Hancock or prejudice against his hypothesis. Naturally, this article should never prove as an excuse to dox, harass, or otherwise interact with any persons mentioned.

With that out of the way, let's ask the question:

**Did there exist an advanced, globe-spanning civilization at the end of the last ice age?**
## What is 'advanced'?
This is the most difficult faucet of Hancock's hypothesis to pin down. Conservatively, Hancock will simply claim that 'advanced' means 'more advanced than currently thought of people at the time'. For the purposes of this article, this is the definition that is used.

~~However, it should be noted that this is likely a facetious description, composed with deliberate ambiguity as to delay the reader's understanding that Hancock's Civilization carries with it claims of giants, telekinesis, and other psychic abilities that these prior peoples may have possessed. **It is important to note that Hancock does not explicitly subscribe to these ideas.**~~ (( FIX THIS ))
## How do you prove a lost civilization?
- **Cultural layers.** Stratigraphic layers of soil that contain evidence for human habitation, such as tools, seeds, bones, etc. One of the most useful and reliable evidences for determining mankind's presence in a given space and time.
- **Material culture.** Statues, architecture, or tools and miscellaneous goods (such as jewelry, pottery, etc.) that all point towards a singular group of peoples; the material remains of cultures that came before. Often found in *cultural layers*—material culture may more strongly suggest Hancock's Civilization than a cultural layer on its own.
- **Structural evidence.** Among our earliest known civilizations exist remnants of structures, whether that comes in the form of remaining foundations, standing structures, or historical accounts of said structures. 

> "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence." — Carl Sagan

If there existed a civilization in this time period (12'800-11'600 YBP)—especially if it were globe-spanning—it would be reasonable to assume that *some* of these evidences would be found by now.

## Meltwater Pulse 1B
At its zenith, the rise in sea level resulting from Meltwater Pulse 1B achieved a mere 1.7 inches (~40mm) per year. This is hardly the apocalyptic scenario that Hancock presents.

**Probably not.**

Graham Hancock (et al.), whether consciously or otherwise, engages in misleading and unscientific rhetoric that is damaging to the broader perception of history and the scientific method. He has built his entire thesis around a conclusion and actively seeks evidence that supports it, rather than proposing a hypothesis and prodding it vigorously from all sides to test for points of failure. Fundamentally, this is not how history is studied (or how any valid hypotheses are formed). What's more is that the vast majority of Hancock's 'evidence' lies in the *god of the gaps*; that the gaps in historical understanding are indicators of this supposed lost civilization. 

This is the gross fallacy that underpins the entirety of Hancock's work.
> *"...Whose eloquent madness so appealed to my imagination that all thought of an analytical criticism has been effectually dispelled."* — Willis Emerson

Hancock does not present a single point of genuine, certifiable evidence that supports his claims. When Hancock *does* present a scenario that seems remotely compelling, one of two things becomes apparent:
1. He is incorrect about a significant faucet of said scenario;
2. He has made unreasonable leaps in logic to draw connections between the scenario and his hypothesis.

**What about radiocarbon dating?**
Also known as carbon-14 dating, this is a scientific method that can determine the age of organic materials with a fair degree of accuracy (the mechanisms of which are beyond the scope of this essay). 

The issue with this method in relation to Hancock's thesis is that *human habitation* repeatedly fails to feature in these carbon dates; Trees, plants, and *any other organic material* that existed in these time periods would provide a radiocarbon dating of said time period. 

That there exists no known human cultural layers (or any human evidence for that matter) in these time periods *likely* points to the fact that humans did not inhabit these areas at these times.

**Non-arguments.**
Hancock has a habit of presenting a scenario in which the conclusion becomes 'this cannot be because I do not believe it to be so'.

## Academia's 'Chilling Effect'
- Mostly agree with Graham here, but not nearly to the extent he claims.
- Why not stand on this platform alone?
## Further Questions
- Why do western scientists in particular seem to act in this dismissive and often abusive manner towards *genuine evidence* to the contrary of their established ideas?
- What is the evidence and scientific consensus on the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis?
	- If accepted, what might be the implications for human development? Human mythos? I'm still not remotely convinced that *nothing* culturally from this time was preserved. I don't even think that's a current claim by academia.
		- Similar stone tools? Styles? ==Look into this.== There ought to be a relatively traceable throughline from, say, pre-Dryas Egypt and the emergence of agriculture, writing, and so on.
		- A sufficient comet impact and the subsequent chaos, even without global, catastrophic flooding, would be a cosmological crux in prehistoric mysticism and entheogen.
		- A fun bit of further reading is in the Plasma Formations in Ancient Skies Hypothesis,[^1] and the broader study of the influence of celestial events on man. 
			- Halley's Comet, which certainly contributed to the events of the Norman Invasion of England in 1066 A.D., and possibly the campaigns of Genghis Khan in 1222 A.D. (among many others).
				- I'm very excited to delve into this. The comet is accounted for in great detail across the Middle Ages, and it was present during *extremely* pivotal events.
## Postscript/Personal Comments
Popular characters like Jimmy Corsetti and Dan Richards, alongside the alumni that fail to properly reckon with these facts, do a vast disservice to the broader perception of historians (professional and hobbyist alike) who are invested in the topics of prehistoric flooding, the ice age, and humanity's place in this tumultuous time by voicing unsubstantiated claims on platforms that fail to challenge them. Their engagement in these theses, while admirable on the surface, lays fertile ground for the compounding of conspiracy theories that subtract from the trust of scientific institutions.

> *"Goodness knows what has been lost to rising sea levels."* — Graham Hancock

These are deeply interesting topics for me: Mankind's place in the ice age and before, warming and cooling periods, and the possibility of a flood (or floods) that might corelate to semi-historical accounts (Genesis, Sumerian mythos, etc.). The rise in prominence in these so-called *alternative historians* makes genuine research into these topics difficult at best; At worst, it opens the doors for being labeled conspiracist or unscientific, thus dissuading discussion.

If these people were truly interested in forwarding human history, they would be focusing their physical, mental, and monetary efforts towards funding and researching current archaeological projects and restoring museums, not appearing on talk shows to bolster their own misguided agendas. The history of our species is interesting enough without the insertion of fantastical empires that are unprovable by design.

It sure is ~~infuriating~~ entertaining, though.

Thanks for reading.
