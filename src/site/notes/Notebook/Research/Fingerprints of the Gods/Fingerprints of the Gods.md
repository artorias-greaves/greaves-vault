This is an article discussing journalist **Graham Hancock** and his recent work, *Ancient Apocalypse* (2022) and its related hypothesis: There was a global civilization that existed before the Younger Dryas period (~12'800-11'600 YBP).
> *"I am trying to overthrow the paradigm of history."* — Graham Hancock
# Preamble
It should go without saying that this article is **not** composed out of hatred for Hancock or prejudice against his hypothesis. This is a topic that is very interesting for me, and once upon a time, I subscribed wholly to Graham's ideas. Naturally, this article should never prove as an excuse to dox, harass, or otherwise confront any persons mentioned.

With that out of the way, let's ask the question:

**Did there exist an advanced, globe-spanning civilization at the end of the last ice age?**
## What is 'advanced'?
This is the most difficult faucet of Hancock's hypothesis to pin down. Conservatively, Hancock (and others) will simply claim that 'advanced' means 'more advanced than currently thought'. For the purposes of this article, this is the definition that is used.

~~However, it should be noted that this is likely a facetious description, composed with deliberate ambiguity as to delay the reader's understanding that this thesis carries with it claims of telepathy, telekinesis, and other psychic abilities that these prior peoples may have possessed.~~
## How do you prove a lost civilization?
- **Cultural layers.** Stratigraphic layers of soil that contain evidence for human habitation. Currently one of the most useful and reliable methods for determining mankind's presence in a given area and time period.
- **Material culture.** Statues, architecture, or tools and miscellaneous goods (such as jewelry, pottery, etc.) that all point towards a singular group of peoples; the material remains of cultures that came before. Often found in *cultural layers*.
- **Structural evidence.** Among our earliest known civilizations exist remnants of structures, whether that comes in the form of remaining foundations, standing structures, or historical accounts of said structures.

> "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence." — Carl Sagan

If there existed a civilization in this time period (12'800-11'600 YBP)—especially if it were globe-spanning—it would be reasonable to assume that *some* of these evidences would be found by now.

## Meltwater Pulse 1B
At its zenith, the rise in sea level resulting from Meltwater Pulse 1B achieved a mere 1.7 inches (~40mm) per year. This is hardly the apocalyptic scenario that Hancock presents.

**Probably not.**

Graham Hancock (et al.), whether consciously or otherwise, engages in misleading and unscientific rhetoric that is damaging to the broader perception of history and the scientific method. He has built his entire thesis around a conclusion and actively seeks evidence that supports it, rather than proposing a hypothesis and prodding it vigorously from all sides to test for points of failure. Fundamentally, this is not how history is studied (or how any valid hypotheses are formed). What's more is that the vast majority of Hancock's 'evidence' lies in the *god of the gaps*; that the gaps in historical understanding are indicators of this supposed lost civilization. 

This is the gross fallacy that underpins the entirety of Hancock's work.
> *"...Whose eloquent madness so appealed to my imagination that all thought of an analytical criticism has been effectually dispelled."* — Willis Emerson

Hancock does not present a single point of genuine, certifiable evidence that supports his claims. When Hancock *does* present a scenario that seems remotely compelling, one of two things becomes apparent:
1. He is incorrect about a significant faucet of said scenario;
2. He has made unreasonable leaps in logic to draw connections between the scenario and his hypothesis.

**What about radiocarbon dating?**
Also known as carbon-14 dating, this is a scientific method that can determine the age of organic materials with a fair degree of accuracy (the mechanisms of which are beyond the scope of this essay). 

The issue with this method in relation to Hancock's thesis (in the rare circumstances it is provided) is that *human habitation* repeatedly fails to feature in these carbon dates; Trees, plants, and *any other organic material* that existed in these time periods would provide a radiocarbon dating of said time period. 

That there exists no known human cultural layers (or any human evidence for that matter) in these time periods *likely* points to the fact that humans did not inhabit these areas at these times.

**Non-arguments.**
Hancock has a habit of presenting a scenario in which the conclusion becomes 'this cannot be because I do not believe it to be so'.

## Postscript/Personal Conclusions
Popular characters like Jimmy Corsetti and Dan Richards, alongside the alumni that fail to properly reckon with these facts, do a vast disservice to the broader perception of historians (professional and hobbyist alike) who are invested in the topics of prehistoric flooding, the ice age, and humanity's place in this tumultuous time by voicing unsubstantiated claims on platforms that fail to challenge them. Their engagement in these theses, while admirable on the surface, lays fertile ground for the compounding of conspiracy theories that have no basis in fact.

> *"Goodness knows what has been lost to rising sea levels."* — Graham Hancock

These are deeply interesting topics for me: Mankind's place in the ice age and before, warming and cooling periods, and the possibility of a flood (or floods) that might corelate to semi-historical accounts (Genesis, Sumerian mythos, etc.). The rise in prominence in these so-called *alternative historians* makes genuine research into these topics difficult at best; At worst, it opens the doors for being labeled conspiracist or unscientific, thus dissuading discussion.

If these people were truly interested in forwarding human history, they would be focusing their physical, mental, and monetary efforts towards funding and researching current archaeological projects and restoring museums, not appearing on talk shows to bolster their own misguided agendas. The history of our species is interesting enough without the insertion of fantastical empires that are unprovable by design.

It sure is ~~infuriating~~ entertaining, though.

Thanks for reading.
