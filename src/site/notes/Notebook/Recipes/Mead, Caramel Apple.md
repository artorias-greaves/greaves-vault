# Ingredients
---
To make 1 gallon of mead:
- 2 lbs. raw honey
- 2.5g wine yeast
- 1g DAP nutrient (optional)
- 1 tsp pectic enzyme (optional) 
- 1 gallon apple juice
- 1 cinnamon stick 
# Steps
---
1. Heat the honey in a pan over low-medium heat until browned, roughly 30 minutes, or to taste.
2. Add the caramelized honey, pectic enzyme, cinnamon stick, and a half gallon of apple juice to a 1 gallon carboy. 
3. Mix the DAP, yeast, and 1 cup of apple juice together to wake the yeast up for about 10-15 minutes. 
4. Add the started yeast and then top off with the remaining apple juice. Mix well.
5. Allow to ferment with an airlock until the yeast has fallen into a solid patty of lees. This usually takes 3-4 weeks. 
6. Rack into bottles and store in a cool dark place. Enjoy at your leisure.
