# Fixing The Enneagram
---
[^1]
- Categorizes human problems, not humans. These types are embedded in story.
- "*I have a type-2 fixation*," rather than "*I am a type-2 person*."
- Inherently negative. Positive traits emerge as potential aspects. They developed those certain skills as a result of a lifetime of maladaptive behavior.
	- There is no healthy 3. There is a person who grew up with a type-3 burden and managed to rein it in.
- Numbers are shorthand, 'The' labels ought to be thrown out.
	- Universal aspects. An American 3 will have American type-3 problems, versus a Japanese having Japanese type-3 problems.
- Thought to be left over from a time when you needed these aspects to have your needs met; ie. in formative childhood years.
- Subcategorized into 3 states depending on *source,* or THIS.
	- Gut:
	- Head:
	- Body:
- Not a test. Not about truth. It's about what works *in the context of storytelling and interpersonal relationships.* To chart a course for growth and illustrate natural challenges for each type.
- Characters from each cluster tend to be familiar with those of like clusters.
- Everyone has bullshit. Let's identify the primary types of bullshit and their storytelling implications.
	- Everyone has all of these bullshits, but one or a few probably took deeper root.
# Type 9

 [^2]
 - **Subtype:** Gut
 - Compulsion is passivity; appears like they can't do anything.
 - A hardening coping mechanism.
	 - Been in a pit for so long they harden to resist.
	 - Put a ladder in front of them and they often can't see it; they've convinced themselves that there's no way up, and they're okay down there.
 - Finding a deep physical passion, rather than overcoming a fear or anxiety.
 - Rocky
	 - Can do whatever he wants, but he's resigned to be mundane.
	 - Story presents the opportunity to *go after it* again.
 - Often have a "one day" symbol: A photo of an object of desire, but lacks the motivation to *go after it*.
 - Transforms into rage at oneself for not emerging sooner.
	 - The Hulk: Rage taking over a passive and meek character.
 - Achieve equilibrium, even if you have to wither away to achieve it. Physical representation can be rot or sickness.
 - "I'm the chillest. Nobody's as chill as me. Just be as chill as I am, come down here." â€” Mentality can seem healthy, but it's a trauma response.
 - Often latch themselves onto another identity because they cannot go after their own.
 - They got that dog in them, but that dog is sleepy. Won't bark at the mailman because he'll just be back tomorrow anyway.
 - Most typical fantasy heroes.
# Type 8
---
[^3]
- **Subtype:** Body
- Need to have power over their immediate environment.
- A cold or defensive character learns to find their ~~heart~~ emotion.
- Beckoning the wild gunslinger out from exile to protect a town. Please Wolverine, we need you! "Nah, I'm out."
- **"Guttiest gut types"**. Very poor regulation. They just want the thing. Very impulsive.
- The ability to submit themselves is a sign of growth.
# Type 7
---
[^4]
- Crave excitement, adventure, and randomness. An anxiety deep within them that pushes them towards constant distraction. The negative aspects of their emotions have been filtered out.
- Puss-in-Boots
- Many stories about responsibility. Iron Man. Jack Sparrow. Saul Goodman.
- Tragedy is to sink into your coping mechanism until you vanish. Moments of clarity at the end. The Wubalubadubdub mindset.
- Filling a psychological hole with *stuff*. The arc is the terror they deny.
