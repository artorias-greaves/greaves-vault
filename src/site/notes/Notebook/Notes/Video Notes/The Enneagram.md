- Inherently negative. Positive traits emerge as potential aspects. They developed those certain skills as a result of a lifetime of maladaptive behavior.
	- There is no healthy 3. There is a person who grew up with a type-3 burden and managed to rein it in.

- Thought to be left over from a time when you needed these aspects to have your needs met; ie. in formative childhood years.
- Subcategorized into 3 states depending on *source,* or THIS.
	- Gut:
	- Heart:
	- Fear:
