Helm is an event roll system. It is designed for use in World of Warcraft, though may be adopted to a variety of settings.
# Create Your Character
---
## Step 1: Select a Skill Level
To make a character in Helm, you must first select a skill level. This reflects your character's fundamental ability to land attacks, deflect damage, solve problems, and benefit their allies. it is the base of all of your interactions done in Helm events.

You may select any skill level you wish, but it should reflect your character's ability. Certain conditions, such as wealth, fitness, loadout, or mood, may naturally confer a higher or lower skill level than those on otherwise equal footing.

You may change your skill level between events.

| Skill Level | Hitpoints | Defence | Roll Table | Ability           | Talents |
| ----------- | --------- | ------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| Novice      | 20        | 3       | 1-20       | Beginner's Luck   | 1       |
| Journeyman  | 25        | 4       | 1-20       | —                 | 2       |
| Expert      | 30        | 5       | 1-21       | —                 | 2       |
| Master      | 35        | 5       | 2-21       | Master's Tutelage | 2       |

> [!NOTE] Definitions
> **Hitpoints.** Determines your character's hitpoint maximum. When your hitpoints reach 0, you are Incapacitated.
> 
> **Defence.** Determines your character's defensive capabilities. When you take damage, your defence is reset to this value.
> 
> **Roll Table.** These are the values that you roll between when prompted to make any roll (unless a roll table is provided for you).
> 
> **Ability.** Special abilities that your skill level may confer. These are listed on your Character Sheet.
> 
> **Talents.** This value denotes the number of Talents that you may select.

## Step 2: Select an Archetype
Your archetype represents your character's preferred role in combat. Archetypes are designed so that characters who are proficient in certain abilities may flourish and not be out-done by those with entirely alternative skillsets.

As with your skill level, you may change your archetype between events.

| Archetype | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Brawler   | - +15 Hitpoints.<br>    <br>- You gain Bully in addition to your other talent(s), and may use it to target as many enemies as you wish.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Sentinel  | - Your maximum Defense is now 30.<br>    <br>- You have the effects of [Spiked Targe].<br>    <br><br>- Passive. Add +2 to your minimum Defense.<br>    <br>- Activate. Make an Attack Roll equal to your Defense value. This resets your Defense.                                                                              |
| Maverick  | - +2 to Attack Rolls.<br>    <br>- Twice per day, you may make an extra Attack Roll during your Ally Phase.<br>    <br>- Your items have one additional charge. If they are Use, they are now Use (2/2).  <br>    Use (1/2) items may not regain charges, and are lost at the end of the event.                                 |
| Rebel     | - Twice per day, you may double your damage dealt in a single attack (after modifiers).<br>    <br>- You have advantage on all of your Attack Rolls, but you can no longer make Support Rolls.  <br>    You no longer benefit from any ally’s passive buffs, Defense Rolls, or Support Rolls.  <br>    You may still be healed. |
| Wingman   | - +2 to Support Rolls.<br>    <br>- Twice per day, you may restore an ally to their maximum Hitpoints.<br>    <br><br>OR<br><br>- Twice per day, allocate a bonus of +30 across your allies’ rolls as you see fit.                                                                                                              |
| Wildcard  | - +2 to Attack, Defense, AND Support Rolls.<br>    <br>- Gain an additional Talent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
## Step 3: Select Your Role (Optional)
Your role is your character's preferred position in the adventuring party. This might not only mean their position in the marching order, but could mean the tools they bring with them outside of combat.

Your role has a crucial place in defining your character in social encounters and exploration-oriented events, but is largely inconsequential when the fighting starts.

You may change your role between events.

| Role           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The Frontman   | You take the lead in the marching order. As a result you are generally the first target of a trap, hazard, or surprise attack, and you have advantage on rolls to avoid them.                                                                    |
| The Face       | You are the talker of the party. You have advantage on all rolls made to charm, lie, intimidate, or otherwise coerce a target—or detect when you are the target of it.                                                                           |
| The Sneak      | You stick to the shadows (and you probably chose Rebel). You have advantage on all rolls made to sneak and hide, and you automatically succeed at bypassing locks.                                                                               |
| The Lookout    | You stand watch while the others do the solving. As a result, you have advantage on all rolls made to spot suspicious activity and incoming danger. You cannot be Surprised.                                                                     |
| The Scholar    | Years of experience (or cheeky magic) has made you proficient in detecting arcana and solving puzzles. You have advantage on all rolls made to discern solutions, and you can learn the effects of special items and enemy spells without fail.  |
| The Freebooter | You’re in it to win it, baby. When you’re shown the hoard—typically the items distributed at the end of an event—you have first dibs at the loot (so long as you know it’s there), and you gain 1-10 additional Treasury coins (guild specific). |
## Step 4: Select Your Talents
Talents are abilities that players may use to provide additional customization to their characters. These are minor spells and actions that may be flavored however you wish, but all have specific effects that can influence the course of an event.

You may use talents alongside items *and* your roll during the same turn unless stated otherwise. Each talent may only be used once per phase, but you may use as many talents as you wish.

Talents may be swapped between events *and* adventuring days.

| Talent              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Uses      |

| Avenger             | When an ally is incapacitated, your next roll is a Critical Roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Passive   |

| Beef                | Gain +10 Hitpoints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Passive   |

## Step 5: Purchase Items (Optional)
Some guilds might adopt an item system to provide an additional layer of character building. 

In Helm's items module, Treasury, all guild members are given a starting allowance of 5 coins to spend on initial adventuring gear. More coins are found or earned during adventures.

A single character may bring with them a maximum of 3 items to an event. Items may be swapped between events.
> [!NOTE] Definitions
> **Passive.** This item's effect is always active.
> 
> **Use.** This item is consumed upon activation, and removed from your inventory.
> 
> **Activate.** 1 charge is consumed (if applicable) and the item remains in your inventory. Restore 1 charge between adventuring days. Restore all charges between events.

You may use or activate any of your items in addition to your roll in that phase. However, items may each only be used *once per phase* unless otherwise stated.
# Character Sheets
---
Players are expected to keep track of their own character sheets. Your GM may be keeping an eye on them, but they often have too much to juggle to keep stats updated.

Unless specifically stated, all abilities may stack onto each other.
